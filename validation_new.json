THEN something horrifying happened, my once favorite coffee place changed! & it morphed into something no longer identifiable. I took my mother to Urban Beans, upon walking in the door the entire restaurant was permeated by extreme body odor. Not only was the smell gagging, but all but 1 of the tables was dirty. The only 1 without dirty dishes was sticky. Still, we attempted to order coffee however, a large mocha & a small black coffee was apparently a brain teaser for the barista. Our simple order was messed up twice. We tried again, by ordering bread pudding French toast. Alas, this was again a big mistake. Not only was our food served cold, it came with no utensils. I was so embarrassed I spent the entire afternoon apologizing to my mom. I have never been back nor will I ever go back. PSA-There is a Tip Jar located at the register but beware, our very astute & creative barista automatically added a 15% gratuity to our bill. AND never request a glass of water or you will be pointed to an empty pitcher without a glass to be found within the vicinity of this zip code. Frightful indeed.",

Do yourself a favor and go to the food court in Palms, because the Chinese food here is horrible. \n\nFirst, we ordered the pho, expecting some sort of resemblance to the savory Vietnamese noodle dish familiar to our (admittedly) spoiled taste buds. Unfortunately, the noodles were too thick, the broth had no flavor, and the temperature was lukewarm. \n\nNext, we got the orange chicken, which was worse than Panda Express's. Once again, it was cooked to a lukewarm temperature, but the texture of the chicken made it apparent that it was bought from Costco or something. \n\nFinally, to everyone familiar with Chinese/Taiwanese hotpot: it's not hotpot.

Then I ordered a green tea martini, which they said that they were unable to make due to the fact that \"nobody liked it\" so they got rid of the green tea liquor. We then ordered 3 sushi rolls for half off sushi night. Once they came out, we each tried a piece of the shrimp tempura roll. The shrimp tasted like it was fried last week due to the fact that it was hard as a rock. We then tried the eel which was entirely skin and no meat. We also both noticed that nothing was very cold. It was all at room temperature, the rice tasted old, and the seafood had a bad aroma to it. After 20 minutes our server finally came over and we told her that everything was inedible. She said \"Okay\" and took our plates away. After waiting 10 more minutes, we got 2 fortune cookies.  The manager never stopped over and apologized, and neither did the server.

    "text": "I've had a very rough yr after first a hysterectomy, then a mesh sling released with another dr.  I decided to see Dr. Byrne (prefer a female dr.) wondering if something had gone wrong after my surgery since both surgeries were supposed to address the recurrent UTI's.   After my initial consult w/ Dr. Byrne I was scheduled for a cystocopy.  Meanwhile I got my 8th UTI (this year) prior to the scheduled procedure.  I'm 66  and no dummy.  I did my research and had more questions.  Anytime I am scoped or catheterized, it results in another UTI. I called ahead to discuss with office mgr that I did not want to be scoped, that instead, I preferred time with Dr. Byrne since I had many more questions.  I arrived prepared with a printed chronological synopsis.  I told her my concerns about being on antibiotics so frequently (i.e. building  up a resistance.)  She directs me to look at the computer screen to see the \"science\", the numbers from the labs and which antibiotic I should take yada yada.   (I've been down this road many many times before).  She had a total disregard from my concern.  I discussed my fear of being scoped again and getting another UTI.  She told me that I need to figure out which doctor is going to treat me. (That was because I had told her I had seen a gynecologist).  I had my list of questions out and she totally shut me down, talked \"down to me like I was a child\".  She explained to me that she was a urologist and a urologist does yada yada.  (Did she think I was a stupid?). She said I had to have the cystocopy before she could proceed.   I may have been willing to reschedule it if she had been patient enough to allow me to ask my questions.   Here I had opened up by soul, with my concerns and fears.  It brought tears to my eyes, because I am so frustrated with  this year-long saga of uti's.  She appeared robotic, unconcerned, rushing me out  to the front desk --disappearing quickly!  She has one of the worst bedside manners I have ever experienced.   I got to the desk and was asked, \"when would you like to schedule the ........?\"  I left there in TOTAL FRUSTRATION!",

We moved out from California. The apartment we were supposed to move into looked like a war zone. The front door was dented, both the dead bolt and door handle looked as if some took a crowbar to them. Once inside we noticed that they did a half assed job at cleaning the apartment. We found a used q-tip in one of the bedrooms. There was what appeared to be knife marks in walls. \n\nThey made this right by giving us an \"upgraded apartment\". \n\nWe got moved in all seemed to be ok. Well the first rain came and that all changed(See the posted photos). The ceiling leaked causing what we called our ceiling zit. They fixed the roof but not the ceiling right away. Next rain it happened again. So they came back out and supposedly fixed the roof again. Some time later they had a gentleman come out and make the repairs to the inside and he did a great job except he didn't paint the wall and it remained that way until we moved out. \n\nCalled the police once for some crackhead and her boyfriend that were blowing weed smoke into her sons face. The son was about 4-5 years old. They finally evicted them. \n\nThey did a facelift on the apartment complex which was just polishing a turd. One of the things they did was to change out all light bulbs and in doing so the new kitchen fixture was smaller than the previous one. Not horrible but you could see up into the roof and it just look awful. That probably has not been fixed. \n\nNewest Management (not sure of the name)\n\nThese folks seemed to be ok. We asked for an extension and it was granted and I am thankful for that. \n\nThis is where it all goes south. We have two cats. We paid the pet deposit. We paid the monthly pet rent. Upon move out we cleaned, we mopped and we had carpets cleaned. I was asked by maintenance days before move out if there was anything wrong with the apartment. I told the gentleman everything that was wrong and he said it's all good and don't worry about anything. The woman that did the final walk-thru was shocked at how clean the apartment was and that it didn't even look like we lived there that long( at this point I was under the assumption that we would receive more than 50% of our deposit back. Well I was proven wrong. I was just informed that I was being dinged for $70 for an additional carpet cleaning for pet odor.

I don't say this lightly because I have worked in customer service for years, so I think I am pretty lenient. \nI was building custom shelves out of piping, and it took me 25 minutes to just find an employee. Once I found him, he was extremely rude, told me I shouldn't bother with the shelves, and went on his way (maybe because I'm a blonde woman?). \nAfter wandering around the store for over an hour, trying to find everything I needed, I ended up buying what I could find and going to a different store. \nI understand that customer service is not everyone's cup of tea, but it's not like I was asking him to build the shelves for me. Just a point in the right direction, or verification that they didn't have any more piping in the back or in another area would have made all the difference.\n\nP.S. my shelves turned out amazing!! If anyone is thinking about building some, I can help you out :)",

The first time I thought maybe I caught them on a bad night I ordered an omelette and some hash browns. There was absolutely no taste my mountain dew was the only item I ordered with any taste. This place was dead both times I came. So last night I came in again. Gave them a second shot. I ordered a chicken steak with gravy and hash browns and two eggs. Again everything was very bland and not exciting. I also ordered a blueberry muffin and surprise their out of it they bring a banana muffin to the table and said sorry were out of blueberry they probably should of said something before they brought the food out. The muffin was very dry and tasteless. Both visits my bill was around 50 bucks for two people and honestly I could of have had a better breakfast at McDonalds. I don't know if the owners or corporate for dupars reads these reviews but I would hope someone makes an effort to reach out because this is not okay and you guys are not justifying these high prices with this very subpar food.",

I understand an establishment not wanting to sere alcohol to someone intoxicated, but no one ordered anything alcoholic to drink. I asked to talk to the manger, which took at least 20 min, he then explained to me that my friend could not stay due to it being a Friday night and its way to busy to deal with this kind of inconvenience. If it was a Monday or Tuesday, no big deal, but since it was a Friday he didn't have the time.

Then I realized they had forgotten the hot mustard that I had asked for so I called them and they delivered that but I gave the driver an extra tip since it was not his fault. So that was more money for something that should have been delivered to begin with. Lastly, when I called to tell them that they had forgotten the spring rolls I ordered and paid for, the woman gave me a very half hearted apology and offered me a credit for next time. They can take their credit and put it somewhere that will flavor their food better. The fried rice is tasteless and the chicken is spongy. The sushi rice was not sticky but rather gooey. The tempura was bland and the sauce was completely flavorless.  They claim to offer huge discounts on their sushi, but that's because they jack up the price and then cross it out on the menu as if they are doing you a favor.

I ended up not eating my burger and just polishing off the fries (which were good).\n\nFinal verdict? I'm literally still shitting, and this review has taken me like 12 minutes to write. Not like - just sitting here writing, but sitting here and actively releasing. I'll never eat at Gilley's again. The only way someone could drag me here would be to stare at the waitresses asses and ride the bull at 3AM.",

    "text": "Terrible experience due to PISS POOR management. \nI've worked in the food industry for 10 years now and I'm extremely understanding in this setting for that very reason. January 20th, 2018 we stopped in after World of Wheels after walking looking for a bite to eat, there was 3 of us, we didn't leave for about 2 and a half hours after walking in.  The manager told us it would be roughly 6 minutes to sit. We waited 10 and then grabbed a drink from the bar, it took us 50 minutes to be sat.  We were highly irritated but never complained.  Once we sat it took about 10 minutes to order, we all got the four course meal. The first round was salad or fries, fries were cold but we were starving so we didn't complain.  Second round was stuffed peppers, phenomenal. The third round was the main dish, pierogies of your choice.  Food was excellent, service wasn't very good but the server who had tables near by noticed and refilled drinks on the house.  Once we ate we were waiting for our server to order the fourth course dessert, she never came.  We went elsewhere for our check. When the server came by she took the check and we asked for our cheesecakes to go.  We never got them but she brought back the check.  We managed to get the managers attention to tell him about how we still hadn't received our dessert, he noticed we had paid and said \"You guys weren't supposed to get a check, i'll be right back with your desserts.\" Roughly 5-10 minutes go by and we decided we'd had enough, we weren't waiting any longer so we got up to walk out where the manager was just standing near the bar.  When he seen us leaving he just started shaking his head. 90 dollar tab, we tipped 20.  Food was great apart from being cold, service was bad (apart from random server near by who was delightful) and the management was just awful. We loved the atmosphere and food selections but because of their treatment we will not return.",

I can't taste the beef broth that is supposed to be cooked for hours to develop this deep flavor, added with the specific spice that gives pho this mouthwatering aroma. And that's unacceptable for a place that is opened 24/7. You should be able to monitor and develop the flavor of your broth. The beef is cut so thinly, I was expecting soft and flavorful. Nope, I assume you have to freeze your beef in order to cut it this thinly and somehow they've manage to lose all the flavor from the meat. I felt like I was eating \"soggy meat\". Did that sound nasty to you? Yes? It was. My fatty flank, there were two pieces with decent fat on it that gave my one spoon of noodle flavor because I scarcely used any soup. The rest of my fatty flank was chewy. The meatball? NEVER. Like no. The taste was not utterly unbearable, but the texture was wrong. \n\nPs. My bf says the restroom is disgusting.

The documentation they gave us stated they went through the factory approved inspection process and assured us many times over that there were no issues with the car. Not more than 36 hours after bringing the car home it started to LEAK OIL. We brought the car in the next day and they held on to it after 2 days then sent us home with the car. The night I brought my car home, my boyfriend checked under the car and it WAS STILL LEAKING OIL. We unfortunately took the car back to camelback madza where several days went by with no phone call or communication from the service department. We had to contact them to see what was going on with our newly purchases (and defective car). After a call with the service director, he admitted they knew about the oil leak before they put the car on sale and attempted to repair it. This repair was NOT DISCLOSED on the Mazda Factory Certification paperwork (there are literally two check boxes specifically stating if engine oil was leaking from the car and if the car needed to be repaired) nor was it disclosed to us when we were purchasing the car! Needless to say after the 3rd failed repair attempt, we took the leaking car to Earnhardt Mazda (a far more reputable dealership) they discovered a CRACK in the ENGINE BLOCK. Earnhardt Mazda repaired the issue in accordance to factory specifications and did a wonderful job making sure I was taken care of.\n\n \n\nSTEER AS FAR AWAY FROM CAMELBACK MAZADA AS POSSIBLE\n\n(no pun intended)",

The \"american\" cheese was basically a kraft singles slice and our wonder bread buns were so soggy and wet I couldn't even eat my burger I was so disgusted. My boyfriend ate it because he was so hungry and his was too small. The fries were okay, tastes the same as Costco but double the price. Finally flagged down our waitress for the cheque, the meal came to 38$ for soggy burgers and fries!

They'd run happy hour deals during the week with the line of customers frequently reaching the door. There was live music and fun times to be had, people watching, and laughter everywhere. It was PACKED.\n\nEverything about it has taken a nose dive... Multiple times. Gone are the days of the gigantic bean grinder and bean counter (more recently  the food counter).

I was also told that I would receive a letter explaining the glitch and that I will be credited the overcharge once the issue is fixed.  I have ZERO confidence in this company and ZERO confidence they will actually automatically give me the credits without me calling in and listening to more lies. Centurylink should be sued.",

If I could I would give this place a 0/5 stars. First, the salon gave us students to do our curl down hairdo. The hairstylists didn't even know what a finger curl was (1920s signature hairstyle). Next it took 2 hairdressers to curl my short bob. 1 hour after leaving the salon I had to return, because my hair had completely straightened. They gave me a Gift Certificate for half my money back (not even Cash back!!!) since they could not give me the hairstyle I wanted. First of all, they knew I was from out of town and the GC is completely useless to me, and secondly, they shouldn't have wasted my time and told me right from the get go. A 3rd stylist curled my hair once again. Well, their stylists and products aren't very good because I went home crying. Finally I got my sister, the bride, to curl my hair on the day of her wedding. She also had to redo hers as the curls had also fallen out in her hairdo. So in all: we didn't get the hairstyle we wanted, we were charged for a professional do that was done by a student (which would be cheaper), the curls they put in didn't stay for anyone, and finally they couldn't even give me my money back, instead they gave me 50% back in a gift card.\nI won't recommend this place to anyone and I will be contacting management as this was completely unacceptable.",

    "text": "I used to like this place a few years ago when there were Mexicans running the place, but since there are new people, it's gone way down hill.  It's no longer the place you would go for good food and and good people.\n\nThe food:  First let me say that while I'm certainly not an expert on Mexican food, I lived near the border for many years. I think I have been exposed to a lot of good Mexican food.\n\nSome  comments about some of the things that I have ordered: The Margaritas are good. That's where it ends.   The salsa is BLAND!  It needs an element of freshness and salt. The tortilla chips come out brown and dry as though they are cooked in old oil.  The chicken tacos that I ordered the last time I was there needed salt and flavor in general!  The same is true for the fish tacos. The pork has a strange after taste. One of the reviewers said cinnamon and that is a decent description.The rice looks and tastes like mush. Again, no flavor. It used to be much better. The Mexican chicken soup is oily and lacks flavor ( big surprise). How can Mexican food be under salted?! It's perplexing.  \n\nThe people/the place:  It's decorated nicely but that's where the warm fuzzy feeling stops. When we walk in there, they are always \"too busy\" to even acknowledge us.  I never feel the owner ( or at least I think she is )  is warm and friendly. It's a real turn-off. \n\nOnce we are seated, and after the ships and salsa arrive, we always have to ask for silverware. Is it too much to pre-set the tables so we can at least have napkins?\nI have the feeling they are trying to cut corners. It's not like it's a cheap place. Very sad because I really want to like this place because of the convenience. It's just not worth it!",

One of the members at our table is allergic to tree nuts, so she explained that to the waitress. When the pasta arrived, there were tree nuts sprinkled on top and in the pasta sauce. As she was waiting to get a new dish, they told her it would be 3 minutes. Ten minutes later, the dish arrived. However we waited the span of our whole meal, waiting for our garlic bread to come. Eventually we asked the waitress when it was coming and she tried to play it off as if we did not order it. The warmest thing we got was the garlic bread that barely had any garlic taste to it. They said they would remove her pasta from the bill, but instead they removed the price of the vegetables, which were the cheapest thing we ordered.

I am disgusted with the atmosphere and the experience as a whole.\n\n I visited the location on Queen ST W and Spadina early this week on Wednesday October the 15th. It was an immediate decision to get a lash refill (eyelash extensions). My lashes were't in bad condition, actually I liked them better before i went in the store than when i left. Before the procedure i politely asked questions about the eye lash extension service they provide, What kind of lashes do you use? What do you recommend? How many lashes do you use per eye?.... Non were answered. I should of known then, but I was vulnerable and tempted to get them done.\n\nThe lady escorted me downstairs to a private room. As we start i realize that the lady did not wash her hands... I started to feel really uncomfortable and immediately questioned my decision. The lady really lacked experience, she really didn't know what she was doing... She didn't even know how to use the tweezers needed to place the extension on my existing lash..... They kept dropping on my face... She quickly gave up using the tweezers to apply the lash and surprisingly, she started applying the lashes WITH HER OWN FINGERS. She was struggling tremendously, dropping the lashes on my face almost every time. At that point I started to really regret my decision.\n\nNot to mention that she was pulling out my own eyelashes with tweezers. This is a NO NO! Every lash technician should know that this pulls out your natural lashes leaving bald spots on your lash line... I now have to use a lash serum so that hopefully my natural lashes can grow back. Remover gel is suppose to be applied before removing eye lash extensions. I even told her to stop because it pulls out my natural lash but she continued.\n\n\nThen end result was horrible. Hardly any lashes were put on my eyes. I liked them better before i came then when i left. I paid for the service because i just wanted to get out of there as quick as possible.\n\n\nI will be contacting the company.... For my money back.",

After she spoke with a manager, she said I could put my parents down for the pass and pay extra for myself to be added on the grandparent section...  My mom had been ill and hadn't got a chance to take him and I was out of town most of the year. The pass was expiring soon so when I was in town I went to take him to the museum where I was told I wasn't on the pass and could not use it! I asked to see the form where I signed myself up and was told they switched to a new facility and they did not have the record of me being added on. I explained I had purchased the pass and it had never gotten used and was still denied to use it! I asked for a manager who would not work with me. By then the museum was closing in 30 minutes and I was told I had to pay full price for BOTH myself and my little brother. I was so upset! Emailed corporate several times and never heard back!

I'm always in the area so Perfect always pop ups when someone is hungry. It is a Scarborough landmark and is open 24 hours. People are drawn to order from their 24/7 dim sum menu. I have been eating here once and a while for over 10 years.\n\nWith some menu items, there is no space for error like congee or anything deep fried. Consistent and simple. The complex dishes, such as chow mein, will come with different recipes/ingredients depending on today's cook.\n\nThe service is a whole different story. It's clear that the waiters are overworked and find little happiness or meaningfulness in their job because they are stern and interact as minimally as possible with guests. Almost as if they have so many horror stories between difficult customers, which I'm sure is all too often considering they get the night owls with post-partying munchies, that they do not care for the impression they leave on guests. Servers I recognize have worked here for years always appear pissed off.\n\nOn one occasion, I waited over 45 minutes between 2 dishes in a single order. It was thrown onto my table with bad attitude because I checked up on its status with the servers twice. I didn't leave a tip when paying. Without thanks and after counting the money in front of us the server raised her voice saying \"NO TIP?\". Yes, no tip! I don't tip shit service.\n\nAnother day, I came in at 6AM. There were 2 other guests in the restaurant. All was fine and well until I caught sight of a staff picking up GARBAGE including dirty tissue and bones off the floor with KITCHEN TONGS! And no they were not marked \"tongs for garbage\", there must have been tons of the same kind used for food! And then we flipped the lid of our tea pot to request more tea, and there was what looked like dark crusted slimy tea leaves or mold on the underside of the lid.\n\nThere is a serious negligence for the health and safety at this restaurant and I can't imagine the state of cleanliness at the back of house/kitchen where your food is cooked. Sadly people aren't able to see this far, or at least at how poorly its owners operate this business and will continue to dine here.",

When a dentist entered the exam area  he looked at them said the crack did not go clear through and when it did I would have to pay full price to have a new plate made. When I disagreed and mentioned they should stand behind their work as I had not dropped them and they obviously were flawed from the start and asked to speak with the manager he said he was and that they would do NOTHING to correct the problem then told me I was being unreasonable and would have to leave. Obviously because they did not want anyone to hear what i was saying about such shoddy treatment. Needless to say I would advise EVERYONE to steer clear of such a patently DISHONEST business.

    "text": "MY wife and I were going to eat at our favorite Indian restaurant in Tempe and found it closed with no explanation, so we drove up the road a mile where we had passed another one we had never tried, called Passage to India. It looked busy and in fact when we were told we could wait a while or be seated on the patio, we never even imagined that we would be waited on so quickly.\nWe ordered pretty quickly once seated, and noticed at the time we were the third couple seated on the patio.  three more tables were seated during the time that we ate some cracker bread with a very nice mint sauce. We started at 7:30pm roughly. We then noticed that after the first of the three earliest tables was served apologetically for the lateness and it was very late when they got theirs, that the two freshest seated tables then got served, and then the server who frankly had the table manner of a truck-stop waitress, with her jokes and comments and style of talking about the place she was working, apologized for the amount of rice but that they had gotten the last of it.  By that I assumed she meant that the serving in the pot was shy of a full serving of rice but then the manager came out, about an hour into our wait so it was around 8:30pm and apologized for the lateness and the few minutes delay in the order printing. The couple that was there before us that had not been served were also told as were we, that our meal would be half priced.\nBy almost 9pm we still had only had two baskets of cracker bread and a couple of drink refills, Dr Pepper and Indian Chai for my wife. \nWhen food finally came out for the couple that had been seated before us, they were told there is no more rice, sorry but we did not expect to get slammed like this.  Meanwhile of course both my wife and I realized that our dishes would also be best served with Rice and an hour and a half into our experience, that was not going to be the case. Any longer and we were going to be late for our 9:30 movie so we left a $5 on the table and left.\nWhile we watched through the window, there were several tables that had been seated after us inside that were already eating so while several of us had a horrible experience that night, it is no doubt also true that many people had a flawless night at the same restaurant.  I guess timing is everything, and I really am not sure if I ever want to give them a second shot, but might try calling the manager this morning although he was the same guy that said he would half price our meal because of the slight delay on the orders.  Umm, an hour and a half is not a slight delay when people that arrived later are getting served all around you.",

I do like the vehicle I bought and think I got a reasonable price, but would not buy another vehicle from here.\nI do not live close to the dealership,  but saw some reasonable prices online, and got a good quote on the vehicle I wanted so I made the 50 minute drive to get here. The salesman seemed fine at the time, very pushy, but that's kind of the name of the job. I had to wait a lot, which again is kind of the name of the game, but for as adamant on finishing the deal that night he was, you'd think he'd pick up the pace a bit.\nMy issues came more after the fact than at the dealership, and not just in the later future, but immediately after. On the way home, I needed to pull over to figure out how to turn on my windshield wipers, I was never showed how to at the dealership. I was shown how to hook up my phone to the vehicle, but only because I openly asked. There was never any time spent to go over what all the dials and knobs did and I have been forced to teach myself. This is all the more frustrating when I was open to come back the next day, but the salesman was dead set on finishing the deal then shorted me because he \"stayed late.\"\nThe bigger frustration came the next day. The initial night I got home late, so did not spend much time reorganizing my vehicle. The next day when I had some time, I realized that the inside was dirty although I was told it was recently detailed, as it was a service loaner. Dust. Dirt on the seats. Personal papers in the glove box. Also a dirty napkin and Combo (yes, the pretzel/cheese snack) on the carpet between seats. Again, car buying is frustrating to begin with, but being actively lied to is absurd.\nAgain, I am happy with my new vehicle, but utterly disappointed with the service I received. The salesman also had the gall to tell me that I will get a survey from Chevrolet to grade his performance and that he does not get a bonus if the highest marks are not given. I can safely say he will not be getting his bonus. Would not come here again for another vehicle, which hopefully isn't coming any time soon, and if asked would inform others to steer clear.",

The fish was cut as thinly as possible, in tiny pieces, over minuscule amounts of rice. The 6 pieces of California roll were also the smallest rolls I've ever seen. Pieces of the avocado were dark and discolored. Neither the fish nor the rice tasted fresh the way they did in the past. The fish was dry, and two of the pieces tasted off. \n\n* Miso soup was hot, but was salty broth, not one piece of seaweed or tofu to be found.\n\n* The soggy lettuce salad was neither cold nor crisp.\n\n* The tea would not even qualify as lukewarm. The staff did not bother to check the temperature before serving it.\n\n* Neither ice nor a lemon slice were offered for the small glass of lukewarm tap water.\n\n* The staff were definitely not busy, yet they paid almost no attention to the few customers in the place, and were neither as efficient nor as friendly as the servers in the past\n\nTotal waste of money!

We purchased drinks twice from the bar and Icehouse Restaurant, and TWICE the bartender gave himself a $275 tip on top of charging us for the drinks. The \"tip\" charges did not show up on our card until two days later - after the charges for the drinks were already charged. We contacted the Edgewater, who gave us a run-around and kept transferring us to different people. Finally, we were connected with the Edgewater's accountant, Jacob Kuhlman, who claimed that it was a mistake on the bartender's end, and that other cards were charged similarly from that night. I'm sorry, but you don't tip yourself almost $600, charge the cards of other customers, and expect me to believe it was a mistake. We've had such difficulty dealing with the Edgewater refunding us our money. What they don't understand is that their charges to our account affected our balance - which became a HUGE burden on us. We had to cancel our cards, and put holds on every other pending charge. The Edgewater told us they would refund us the price of our drinks for their mistake. This was all refunded one week ago. Yesterday, March 1, we were once again charged for the drinks from the Edgewater. We've contacted the Edgewater again. No response from them. You can't even pay me to go there!

And we decide anything is better than nothing. \n\nThen the third employee at checkout calls us up to pay. We pay the bill and when we get the receipt we notice that no discount was applied. We asked the employee why we didn't receive a discount from the warranty and he said it was a small discount so he didn't think that we would want it. What the heck?!? Why would we not want to save money?! So we ask him how small the discount is and he admits that he didn't even calculate it.

I never received pre-move paperwork and was surprised to learn the day of the move about packaging instructions and what can and cannot be moved, which I had specifically asked about in several phone calls to the office. \n\n3 men completed the move. 1 out of the 3 had absolutely no business being employed by a moving company dealing with furniture or heavy objects. He struggled with my dresser and several times, I instinctually stepped toward him because it looked like he was going to fall and/or drop the dresser completely. He \"rested\" the dresser on a stair while they tried to get it up the stairwell. These \"rests\" caused several punctures in the back of the dresser because it was banging into the top of the landing banister each time. \n\nAt the end of the move, I sat down with the guy who was in charge and gave him the necessary information for the damage claim. After this was done, another guy started to fill out the rest of the paperwork and add up the time and cost for the job. This took several minutes and he did all of the calculations without a calculator and had to review the numbers several times. He then told us we were being charged for an additional 15 minutes because the move was estimated for 3 hours (9:30am - 12:30pm) and he did not finish the paperwork until 12:32pm. \n\nAfter the paperwork was done, they returned to the truck and I walked upstairs to further inspect my dresser and saw that the boxspring that was supposed to be on the bed was in the wrong room and the other boxspring was resting against a dresser and the mattress resting against the wall. I moved the boxspring into the correct room and placed the mattress on the boxspring and then noticed a block of wood (part of the bed frame) sitting on the floor. I ran outside and luckily the truck was still there and asked them to return to finish putting together the frame. First they said it had come from somewhere else and then when we pointed out that there was an identical piece on the other side, they put it together to include this piece. \n\nI was told I would be contacted to arrange a time for someone to look at the dresser in order to replace the back panel. I did not hear from them for a week and then called and was given the number of their wood worker. I called him and left a message. I didn't hear back and called the main office again and told them I had left him a message and not heard back. They said they would follow up. I did not hear from them again and finally called the corporate office. I was reassured that they would follow up with the local office and I should hear from someone shortly. After several days, I called back to the corporate office and she looked up my information and said that she had never heard back from the local office. She also did not think to contact them again or reach out to me. \n\nMaybe next month someone will actually come out to look at the dresser and by next year it will be repaired.

Especially upon move-out. I've never been charged for so many little things that typically constitute normal wear and tear. Because, you know, people live there. The people in the office are mostly useless and will give you a good dose of that good old southern passive aggressiveness every time you contact them.\n\nLike others have said.

The carpets were kept very clean, vacuumed almost daily due to feline companion, and any spills that occurred during occupancy were treated properly to remove them. There was never any pet mess on my carpets. I have lived in countless apartments due to moving for work and have never experienced something like this. They know they can get away with it because it is too small a charge to hire a lawyer for. I've read that a lot of people experience this issue with this company. I'm sure they replace the carpets between tenants anyway, but they pass the cost onto the prior tenant. Good business practice guys. \n\nStay away!

Our service was very slow but we weren't in a hurry as we were partying but it soon became clear that tables that arrived after us were being served before us and actually finished, paid and left before us. \n\nThe pasta dishes we ordered were totally unsatisfactory. The gnocchi was small and hard, - not light and fluffy. The waitress explained that it was because the gnocchi was potato based. Isn't that what gnocchi is?  By definition?  And light and fluffy is how they should be.  The Gorgonzola sauce was gloppy and anything but generous. Hardly enough to moisten the gnocchi. I had to request some parmigiana cheese to add some flavour to the dish. The seafood penne was supposed to have a white wine sauce but it was served dry and not hot. The pasta seemed to have been boiled and left on the counter for 20 minutes before serving as it was dry (not enough sauce) and flavourless. \n\nThe manager listened to our complaints and kindly offered to comp one of our two bottles of wine and brought us a free tray of desserts. They were so bad we actually left them without finishing them. And my wife would normally NEVER leave chocolate on the table.  In this case we left the chocolate ball (no chocolate flavour), the panacotta (too much gelatine) and the cheesecake (totally dry and not creamy) - horrible stuff. \n\nSeparately, the ladies room had no toilet paper in one of the stalls which was pointed out to the staff.  Later in the evening during a subsequent visit to the ladies room there was still no toilet paper in the stall. Similarly, the men's room was very dirty with water splashed everywhere and dirty floors.  This should have been our warning before we began. \n\nWe will never go back.",

They have just been having the worst service i have ever seen from that place. it's impossible to notice they aren't as busy as they used to be because most of their clients have left. My sister, nieces, my mother, some of my friends all used to go there as well but stopped and switched to a different nail salon because of how terrible their customer service has gotten and their nails aren't as good as they used to be. Today I called them twice around 1:15pm before going in and got no answer so i figured they were busy but i went in they weren't busy at all so then i proceed to ask about how long for a gel manicure, the young man asked and the heavier set lady, that always has a ugly attitude and always messed up my nails and eyebrows, responded with \"we don't know how long so if you can wait we can do them for you and if you can't then you can go\" i looked at the young man and he said with a smirk on his face \"we don't know how long\" i looked at them in shock and i was going to wait but they didn't deserve my money after the service they had just given me, so i said \"ok thanks\" and left. I am now getting my nails done at Red Nails on 24st and baseline and i'm highly satisfied! I called right after i left Pro ten with their disgusting service and asked them the SAME question i asked at pro ten and red nails told me \"10-15 minutes\". i showed up and was greeted and sat immediately AND they were A LOT more busier than pro ten.

When arriving the plumber that was sent, told me that there would be a minimum charge of $275.00 to find the leak, but that the charge could be applied to any work that needed to be done. I thought that was a bit high, but since I needed the repair done, I agreed. I also thought they must use this practice to ensure that they didn't spend alot of time in discovering a leak only to be told that a customer didn't want the repair done. After 10 minutes, he discovered the leak was coming from a faucet in the master bathroom sink. However, the faucet was located inside a wall that was covered by a mirror mounted to the wall from the countertop to the ceiling. He told me that I'd have to get someone in to remove the mirror. I understood and agreed. At that point he gave me an invoice for the $275.00 he quoted. I asked if this payment would apply to the repair that needed to be done after the mirror was removed and he told me no! That would only apply to work done the same day. I was furious! $275.00 for a total of 30 minutes spent in my home and no work completed. \nI had the mirror removed, and had them back to do the repair, only to have them come a second time and now inform me that the faucet component that was inside the wall should be replaced. So he left and told me that he would include the bill for that day when he came back to replace the faucet after I went to a supply house and found the part needed. After finding the necessary part, I considered using a different company, but I figured that I was in this far with Epic, I may as well let them finish. The same plumber came back and replaced the faucet body. The work took about 45 minutes. He then presented a bill for $500.00!!! He told me that the exorbitant charge was what they normally get just for the faucet replacement, but he actually discounted that to $350.00 and then $150.00 for the prior days to tell me to get a new faucet. \nI hate to be taken advantage of in situations like this but I paid him the $500.00. Afterwards I kicked myself for the next few days. I will NEVER use this company again, and suggest you don't either.",

My wife and I went for a matinee to catch the new incredibles two movie for $5. In a movie theater with several popular movies being played, the line to purchase tickets had two registers open, we arrived 45 minutes prior to our movie playing, the line took about 15 minutes. After that, I went to grab concessions, this line quit literally took 25 minutes, only for them to hand me a cup and make me poor my own drink, because $6 isn't enough for somebody else to do that. Then we arrive at our screen, my wife went in and saved me a seat, the floor was covered in soda, popcorn, and whatever else you could imagine, cups still in holders, and the seats covered in food. After that, people were coming into the movie from start to finish, to the point where every seat was full AND people were sitting on the steps. People were loud and obnoxious, and not once did staff come in to check. Despite a decent movie, this was the most un-enjoyable experience I've ever had at a movie theater anywhere. I'm sure amc as a company has far better standards than this.",

For the hotel, booked World tower then decided to upgrade to Lux, so I contacted the SLS, they told me no problem when Check-in. Two week prior to my trip, I called again to confirm I was able to upgrade. I really wanted this weekend perfect and that was planned for several months. Was assure no problem in upgrading to the LUX upon arrival. \n\nArrived last Friday night, not only did they give my room away on a high floor king, there was no upgrade available (due to convention-WHICH TWO WEEK PRIOR I SHOULD OF BEEN INFORMED THERE NO UPGRADES!!). They instead gave a low floor two full bed option. FULL BED- not on Birthday weekend. More to it I will not get into, but to top off our pool day after flying out day before, it was closed (due to event). Only option was the Foxtail Day Club, which was not the relaxation desired and you have to pay to get into) Leaving out SO many details, for the inconvenience I was offered a $25 food/beverage credit and they waved they little resort fee. THAT WAS IT. Oh, yea, the shitty room I got in Story Tower which was less, NO FUCKIN ICE MACHINE OR BUCKETS. I contacted corporate and the hotel main, they are they ones that dropped the little resort fee, the pathetic hotel gave the 25 credit - if they made up the inconvenience, I would not be writing this. i gave them week to fix, never again. Too bad for a hotel that only opened a year ago. They need to value guests pre-booked and pre-paid.",

The bar was pretty packed but most of the bartenders didn't seem to have any urgency, probably took at least 10 to 15 mins to order with them.  Our server at our table, Rebecca, was by far worse than the bartenders though.  She appeared to write down our order but then came back 5 mins later asking us about our orders again.  Every time she came to the table she had some excuse as to why something took so long or wasn't right and always had someone else to blame.  I hate when servers complain all the time.  Before our food came we ordered a blue moon, Rebecca told us she would get it after she got all the other drinks she needed to get for other customers, as if we were being a nuisance.  We got our food which was luke warm so probably had been ready for a while, then had to request silverware from another server.  Still waiting on a beer.  Ate all our food, still waiting on our beer.  Cleaned up our plates, still waiting on our beer.  Eventually Rebecca came up to our table and placed the receipt on the edge without asking if we needed anything else and said \"oh did you still want that blue moon\"  we told her no and she said \"I didn't think so\" and walked away.   Rebecca is not meant to work in the service industry.

When it came time to ask for my deposit back is when I knew this was gonna be a problem. The reaction of the waiter that I asked for a refund of the deposit was like he had never heard someone ask for a refund. He had no idea how to handle the issue and had to get another waiter, who wanted to apply it to one of the checks! I explained my meal was paid for and I was not going to apply my deposit to someone else's check. He asked how I wanted it I said cash would be cool, but if not just refund my card, gave him my card and he left. About 15 minutes later he returned my card and made me sign a refund receipt. We left to continue our night. Monday comes and I check my account and see that I have not received my refund. I call and they explain it would be there Tuesday since it was done on a Friday night. No refund on Tuesday so I call again and they acted like they had no idea what I was talking about and said they \"couldn't find the paper\" so I had to text a picture of my receipt to the daytime manager Lupita who then texted me back that my refund will be there to check and if not wait 24 hrs. as of today no refund. I text her to inform her and her response is to wait 2 more days. How can they instantly charge the deposit to my account but it somehow takes a week to put it back!!?

I rarely if ever post reviews on Google, however, if I could prevent just one person from renting from this company or hiring them for their rental management services, then this review is worth my time. Considering one of the (3) five star reviews on Google is literally from this company's Manager raving about how wonderful it is to work for this company and how \"exceptional\" their customer service is, I felt obliged to writing a review from the tenant's perspective. In response to the Managers comment about it being hard to please everyone; yes, very much so. However, I believe I speak for everyone in this review thread when I say, the customer service is unfathomably awful.  These problems are not matters of \"people pleasing\" but tenants respectfully requesting to have working appliances within a reasonable time frame, and decent customer service if anything at all and this company is light years away from that. I simply cannot associate bad customer service with \"protecting the client's investment,\" or \"putting the client's first.\"\n\nAside from the tasteless comments that were given from their staff, our service requests were closed out, ignored and other services requests were looked at by their \"repair man\" who did essentially nothing to fix the problem. At the beginning of our lease we went months without a working washer. When we decided to request a deduction on rent for the time gone without a working washer from our property manager Kim, she bantered back and forth with me saying we did not have a right to a reduction on our rent, referencing that we could easily take our laundry to a laundromat. Our leaking air conditioner also went about 2 months without being fixed, and my cousin slipped and fell injuring his back. Eventually after speaking with the head manager Mike Gross and threatening to gain legal counsel we received a slight deduction in rent for the month.  Regardless, it was a situation that was handled poorly from the very start. It is outrageous to think that even after my cousin injured his back because of a service request going ignored; our property manager not only regretted to give us a simple apology but instead became rude and disrespectful. If that's not terrible customer service, I don't know what is.  \n\nFortunately, we will no longer be continuing our lease with this company, I informed the landlord that although we love her unit, and although she is a wonderful person, we will not accept dealing with an awful company like Property Management Solutions or \"Entrust Reality\". In addition, I received an email today about charges being posted on our lease, meanwhile they have chosen to deactivate our account, further (attempting) to hinder us from retrieving proof of past work orders, and problems. \n\nMy cousin and I are reasonable people and have had our fair share of jobs working in customer service fields.  It is my hope that this company has reviewed the last few complaints, and decided that it is time to hire employees that value their customers, landlords, and tenants and will further think long and hard before they presume poor customer service will go ignored and go without consequence.",

DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY HERE the people are loud and ghetto and they have 0 respect for others the kids are unsupervised they throw rocks and don't care if they damage your car and best believe there parents won't do anything about it if your car window gets broke or your car gets dented. I work all day and have to come back home and find that my ASSIGNED parking space is taken so I have to park elsewhere and if you see the person in your space don't bother trying to be an adult and asking if they could move you'll fuck around and be in a fight‍. Besides the engine jets that are constantly going all day and some times late at night which is expected cause I'm literally across the street from the air force base it's the people that makes it truly unbearable to live here. The police are constantly here and I've seen people car windows get busted out not by the kids but by grown mf's that handle there disputes by trashing people's car. I'm very sad that I had to come here to live and mind you I've only been here THREE MONTHS and I was sick of this place within the first MONTH!!!! If I had more time to choose an apartment I wouldn't have come here but since I was in a time crunch and couldn't wait I had to do it but this place is one notch up from living in a ghetto disgusting weekly motel. The groundskeepers do a good job with keeping the grounds clean I would suggest they call pest control to deal with all the pigeons. Office staff are nice and helpful so that's a plus, maintenance is slow my bathroom sink wouldn't drain and it took them 3 months to fix it and everything in the apartment is outdated old and literally crusty my kitchen floor is all warped and unlevel to the point were it's like walking on waves, there's a leak in my ceiling so when it rains outside it rains in my kids room as well, all the outlets in my apartment can't hold a plug so if you plug in your phone or charger be sure to have something up against it because it will come half way out and sometimes start to spark or just mess up your charger or whatever you plug in. These apartments would have so much potential to be great if the owners got off there asses stopped being so dam cheap and actually took care of there property and tenants that includes enforcing the rules more and upgrade these raggedy ass apartments. I plan on breaking my lease in the next month or so and running far away from this place before I have a nervous break down. Note nothing I said is exaggerated by any means I'm not saying this out of anger I truly want to help the next person that is thinking about moving here cause what you see in them photos on Apartments.com do not represent this apartment at all it's all LIES.

We did mention this was our first visit to our server. Many items sounded great and were reasonably priced. We made our selections and placed our orders with our server. She gave us our beverages as my husband stepped away to use the restroom. \n\nA few minutes later the hostess returned asking if we placed our order and I said yes. She asked who took it and told her who took our order. Our server returned to inform me the lunch menu is not available and we had to choose something off the regular menu which is family style portions that we would share. She apologized explaining neither her or the hostess work on Sundays.  \n\nWhen my husband returned from the restroom, I let him know what happened and we would have to choose something else from the regular menu. We decided we would just go since that is not what we wanted and the prices were hugely different. \n\nTo top things off - after we informed our server of this, we were still charged for our sodas. Since the error was not our fault, you would think that they would have honored our order that was already taken. This was poorly handled and since this was our first visit here ever, we would have hoped the staff would have done their best to ensure we would want to return like simply not charging us for sodas that were $7.00! We definitely won't be returning here regardless if we have a gift card.",

Please don't waste your time and money to come here.\nLong version of this review: I made a yelp account just to write this review. This is the worst taste I've ever had in a restaurant. I ordered Spicy Tonkotsu Miso Ramen, the broth tastes decent but the bamboo shoots taste horrible and smells gross. They don't taste fresh, they taste like canned bamboo shoots you can buy at China Town. The thing that upsets me most was the Buta Shio Bukkake. My girlfriend ordered it and it was nothing but udon noodles in clear soup with three extremely thin slices of burned grill pork and three sticks of green onion. The soup tastes like boiled water with oil and burned smells, and the worst thing is that it costs $9! I will attach pictures at the end of the review. It was so bad that I had to ask the server to take it back. The restaurant let me order something else instead. I ordered Chicken Karage Don, which tastes blahhh at best. The chicken tastes so bland and the miso soup that came with it tastes horrible. The tofu in the miso soup tastes like it hasn't been washed prior to cooking. I don't understand how they can serve food that tastes so bad to customers and charge this price. It's ridiculous.\nOverall, definitely avoid this restaurant at all costs if you don't want to ruin your appetite and waste your time and money. I would not even eat the food there again even for free.",

I am at the age that I have a very little window to get pregnant and they wasted about 8 months of that time.

It had that homey feel of eating in someone's basement. That's about where the charm ended.\n\nMyself and my big party (10 other people) received a lot of attitude from the wait staff, when we were fortunate enough to get his attention. As others have commented, you can see the stacks of microwaves in the kitchen. As others have commented, they don't put out real olive oil on the table (is it really that expensive? I don't think so). \n\nI will admit, the main dish I ordered was actually tasty (some lemon chicken), but that lemon chicken was accompanied by a sad bowl of penne with marinara sauce. Really? And the same went with the majority of the dishes. We also ordered a lot of appetizers, and the stuffing for the stuffed peppers reminded me of cat food and saw dust. To round it out, it took an hour to get the check.\n\nI really like eating at a ethnic, locally owned restaurant, but I will never go back to Primo Vino again.",

Once the service department figured out the issue they instructed that it would take at least a full day to fix it (mind u I had to find someone to take me to work that day). They informed me that they will call me the next following day so I can pick up my car and of course I did not hear from any one. The next day I called back for a update myself to be informed my car was still being serviced. So I then demanded a loner car because apparently I still was in need of transportation for work. After a week goes by they called to inform me that my car was fixed. Maybe two days went by my car was acting up once again.

The hotel smelled like coconut milk, which wasn't appealing to our group. I guess they were trying to work with the tropical theme? Uh huh. We showered in cold water for most of our stay at the hotel. We called the staff to have someone come by and fix it. A man came by to \"fix\" it. We tried the water again- still COLD. We then complained to the front desk, who was quite courteous. The front desk woman gave us a change of room and $30 to use for room service (enough for 2 measly breakfast orders for the four of us). The first round of showers in the new room finally had warm water, but that's it. All the showers after that ranged from very slightly warm to coolly cold. Maybe we had bad luck. Maybe the water system was understandably affected by some outside force. Either way, I ain't gonna step into this coconut milk-smelling hotel again.",

They have a few private dining areas which are really nice, and their booths all have private TVs. They have a great, convenient location, and have a really full menu that has something for everyone. \n\nSo why don't I love it? Well I'm extremely partial to sliders, and upon my first visit there I was so happy to see that they have tons of slider options. The first time I ordered them, it was St. Patrick's Day, and it was insanely busy. They got my order wrong the first time, but quickly changed it. However, when I did get my sliders, they were cold! So disappointing, but I decided to give them another chance, since it was so busy that evening. Maybe a week later I went back to try the Chicken Wing Sliders... unfortunately, they got my order wrong again... but this time I was in a rush and just ate the sliders. They were good, not great. The main issue I have with them is that they have a \"wonder-bread\" type bun. Just empty white-bread carbs that basically taste like nothing-ness - and if you're paying around $15 for sliders, I would hope to have something a bit better! I've been a few other times and have had salads (which are decent) and also they make an excellent Caesar, which have little pepperonis as a garnish!

After countless delays, and missed opportunities due to the restaurant being closed we had our chance!  Since there are three of us, we decided on the family meal with slaw and beans as sides.  Our first choice was cheesy potatoes, but as often is the case mentioned in other reviews, they were out of something.  Overall I will say the menu is pretty limited, and you shouldn't expect to find the variety you would find at a Rudys, or Honey Bears.  As for the food, put it this way.  We ended up throwing most of everything out and going to plan B.  The positive was the lean quality of the pulled pork.  That's where it ends however.  The meat had absolutely no flavor, the store bought hamburger rolls they give you tasted stale, the BBQ sauce tasted only like ketchup, the beans had no flavor or texture, and the slaw was dry and loaded with ground pepper.  I rate \"Got Que? \" a two out of five based on the lean quality of the pork and friendly staff.  Overall however I just literally throw $25 in the trash, and just don't see a reason to return.

I just assumed that was the 13.5 and it was just a bit too big. We ended up with it since it seemed like I had no choice or go back to the 13 she already had which I mentioned and he said oh that would be too small. After we pay and leave I look at the slippers in the car and I see it's a size 2. Two sizes up from what she had!!! Why did he not have her try on at least the size 1. The 2 was the last 2 size he had because I wanted a pair that wasn't dirty, so was it just a scheme to get rid of the 2!! It doesn't make sense. I should have checked but of course this is their profession and I trusted they knew how to fit shoes. I ended up having to buy the correct size off of discount dance online for still $10 cheaper even paying for shipping. I'll just keep the size 2 for when she is older.

We weren't the largest party there and definitely got there before a couple of the larger parties. \n\nWe didn't get our food until a quarter after 8 after watching the larger parties that were seated after us receive thiers.  I asked our server to bring us some to go boxes when she brought the food out, as well as the check, as we didn't want to miss the show we planned to watch and we didn't receive it for another 15 minutes.  I'm tempted to say that our server didn't place our order immediately or was too occupied with the trainee that was following her around to notice that we were in a hurry, even after I asked for the check. \n\nThe food wasn't bad, but will likely never eat here again and just spend time at the Rum Bar.",

It was a Friday night and was very busy and I understand that but the service was terrible. The person serving soup told me to move down the line, that he would get our soups ready. I didn't even have the opportunity to let him know what toppings we wanted on our soup. We sat down and I went to get our drinks. I accidentally dropped a cup and told the gentleman, who was standing right next to the drink station, that I had dropped my cup and could I get a new one? He said, \"Yeah, just go up to the counter and ask for another one.\" I had to go back to the line and cut in front of a bunch of people to ask for a new cup. How hard would it have been to get one for me? This kid needs some training. Next, my salad was tasty and so was my son's soup but everything else was awful. My daughter got the tomato soup, which tasted like they dumped a truckload of sugar in it, we had asked for cheese on top and never got it. She couldn't eat it. My soup, the Chicken Tortilla, tasted like a salt bomb went off. There are plenty of other places where a family of four can spend almost $50.00 for dinner and get much better service. We won't be back.",

    "text": "Review #27 of Yelp's 30 Day Challenge 2012\n\nI had heard a lot about this place...in fact was due to meet a friend here for dinner a year ago and plans fell through.  And so expectations were high...maybe too high.\n\nI had made reservations a month prior since we had cousins coming into town joining us for dinner & a concert later.\n\nWe arrived and the place was not that busy for a Sunday evening.  But right after us people started coming in and it filled up.\n\nWe enjoyed reviewing the menu selections and ended up ordering quite a feast which included 2 charcuterie boards and another 6 tapas.  Initially the waitress was a little pushy trying to get us to place an order and hovering (nothing like feeling pressure) and when I finally ordered the wine for the table she seemed slightly taken aback that I ordered the wine instead of the menfolk (I worked in the biz 20yrs ago and I know wine, so really who cares who orders).  Our cousin (the other lady in the group) ordered a flight of wine tasters and was waiting for the charcuterie to arrive so she could enjoy some of the cheese with her wine.  45 minutes later we finally had to enquire as to where are meal was since we had a concert to go to in an hour.\n\nWhat we were \"told\" was there was a large group in the house and only 2 in the kitchen.  What we \"heard\" was we didn't properly staff our restaurant for this evening and so all the customers food will take a long time.  Seriously a charcuterie board taking 60 minutes??  10 minutes later it finally arrived.  It was certainly delicious but the wine flight had long been consumed by this time.  5 minutes later the tapas started arriving and of course we were running late so everything was eaten hastily and we can't help but wonder prepared this way also.  The BC Seared Scallops were gritty although the broth was tasty.  The Eggplant Chips were missing the eggplant and all you could taste was the crispy coating.  The Falafels were doughy inside.  The Flight & Bite with Lamb Stew was good.  The Artic Char was good....the Lobster Nachos had a nice flavour but seemed to be missing lobster (3 pieces is all we could find).   Finally the Flank steak arrived and made hubs happy.  Cooked to perfection.  Even more delightful were the accompanying cooked winter greens.  Holy deliciousness...everyone agreed and we chowed down on those delectable greens like hungry little rabbits.\n\nDuring our meal we asked for the wine menu again since the cousin with the empty wine flight had not been asked if she wanted anything further to drink.  For a waitress who was hovering at the beginning we had to battle to get and keep her attention now.  Our cousin was drinking white and asking for suggestions.  She was given a recommendation by the waitress who then turned to leave without addressing any of the rest of us.  We called her back...since we also wanted to order more wine.  Wow does body language speak volumes and we felt like we were imposing on our waitress.  I ordered 2 more wine tasters for hubs & myself.  Then the waitress turned to run away again not even addressing the white wine drinker who was also ready to order.  We called her back YET again and uneasily felt like we were still bothering her.  Since we were already late for the concert we had no time for dessert or an after dinner beverage.\n\nWe spent a lot of money for a mediocre evening and left slightly disappointed by the overall experience.  The cousins advised they enjoyed the company and some of the food/wine but this would not be there first choice again.  As for us I am hoping it was just bad planning and a bad night for the restaurant unfortunately at our expense.  I can honestly say I would try any of the other dozen wine bars first before rushing back here.  First impressions......",

And even after the very small gesture they gave, providing us with one complimentary cocktail each, the drink bill showed up on my final statement and had to go to the front desk at 6am before we left for the airport to clear up the charge, which took about a half hour. Thanks, but no thanks. \n\nI thought about giving it just one star, but the property is beautiful (everything looks identical from when it was Loews) so that's worth one more star.

We were directed into the area where vehicle stereos, GPS, and Radar Detectors were.  The was no sales associate anywhere to be found.  I spotted a Blue Shirt walking briskly like Pac-Man in and out of the aisles.  My fiance gave chase and finally hunted him down.  She asked for assistance and he quickly got on his CIA approved ear bud and called someone to assist us.  Ok, cool, we got someone on the way.  Still waiting for another 10 minutes, I sought out the small kid again in the Blue Shirt, and not knowing I was with my fiance, he seemed eager to help me.  I told him what I needed, and he then realized I was with her and knew that I was just getting fed up.  So, again, he called for someone on his ear bud, not sure why he just could not help us.  So, instead, a kid from the camera section comes over who barely knew anything about the remote start, let alone anything in the automotive area.  We had many questions to ask, and at first he seemed to take them on decently, but then it was getting out of his realm.  He called for an installer, and slowly slipped away, as someone was chatting in his ear bud about a camera question.  This whole process was approximately 35 minutes now.  I think we waited another 2 mintues and walked out of the store.  That is the first time I have walked out of a Best Buy disappointed!!  I really don't know if I would go back there.  I know I wont for anything auto related.  The sad thing is, we called Auto Sound in Willoughby, and were given all the answers to the questions we had over the phone, and bought and installed the remote start that same day!!!!  Best Buy had us waiting a week!  All in all, I think the Automotive area of Best Buy is lacking and I don't think their associates in the store know too much about that stuff.... It is the installers who can really help but they are busy in the garage.  They need to get a rep who know what they are doing, but in my case, they are too late...

I had been seeing Dr. Schwartz for a few years and almost every time the going got rough, he would resort to either medication increases or stacking another medication on top of the one I was taking at the time instead of entertaining other approaches to treatment. Being somebody who is pretty reluctant to take every medication thrown at me, this was not a very effective solution for me. When I tried to explain that I wasn't comfortable with medication increases or additions, he would simply say that \"we should stop seeing each other as we might not be a good fit for one another\". This to me was disgraceful as he seemed to just tap out when either I wasn't perfectly willing to take more medication or when the situation was difficult. Each appointment was 30 minutes at $180 and never really accomplished much aside from me getting another prescription written. The frustrating part is once I finally became stable, had a decent amount of time under my belt w/ the medication and was moving along nicely, I called to ask for a refill of my medication but was denied because I didn't make a physical appointment. I did not have the money for the appointment and was at that moment out of medication. Instead of just working w/ my pharmacy and refilling my prescription so I could continue to do as I was doing successfully and not have a disruptive period of no medication, he denied my refill and made me go w/out it. This was highly inconvenient and caused me to finally severe ties w/ him due to him seeming to care more about my $180 than my personal wellbeing.\n\nWould not recommend to family, friends or strangers.",

I don't know my servers name, however she (a younger female) was knowledgeable and pleasant. My meal which consisted of pho, and crispy spring rolls, which is my favorite. There is usually a gentleman at the register, but I didn't see him today. I wanted to thank him for his suggestiions of my take out lunch the last time I was in. It was a hit!  OK that's it for the pleasantries. There was a little short grumpy women, who has never waited on me before. My bill was $17 and I left a $3 tip on the table. When I stopped at the cashier to pay my bill, the little short grumpy women asked me if I had cash. I said \"sorry, I don't have anymore cash on me\" The little short grumpy women, then rang everything and applied the balance to my debit card. I still had to sign my receipt. When I handed it back to her, she turned the receipt toward me and asked \"No tip!\"? I looked at her a little confused at first, but replied \"I left it on the table\". Now my blood pressure is rising, and I wanted to say a few things to her, for insulting me. I decided Yelp would be a better way to go. She also reprimanded a young man (I believe he's new) in their language about the number of place settings on the table. I don't know his name either, but he wore black framed glasses and worked the room with the younger female server. You could tell by the expression on his face, that he was a little embarrassed, since she yeld across the room. \n\nWell the little short grumpy older woman ruined my lunch. I thought about her condescending remark to me all the way home. Hopefully she is not the owner, because she should be a bus person only. This same little short grumpy older women borrowed the hot sauce from my table. She didn't ask, but she did say hello as a distraction while she had to reach pass  me to get it.When the little short grumpy older women retuned the hot sauce it literally was a drive-by. It startled me to see the hot sauce sliding across my table like a baseball player sliding into home plate. She never broke her stride, and never looked back.\n\nI've been eating lunch/early dinner here since 2004, and as much as I really love the food, I haven't decided if I will ever go back.

Wrong....apparently the place still has the newness factor and I drove around 10 minutes trying to find a parking space   I tried the valet parking across the street but they were full and I ended up driving around before settling on a space 3 blocks away.\n\nThankfully there were a couple of seats at the bar which I claimed one.  Looking around the place, I felt really old here. The place seems to cater to the younger crowd even at 8pm.  \n\nThe bar was busy. It was about 10 minutes before someone even acknowledged me.  Then I asked what their beers were and she explained them (little did I know that the menu she would hand me in a few minutes would contain a list of their beers).  Thankfully they have a bunch of craft beers on tap.  \n\nThe food menu is small and consists of apps (think chips with salsa, queso or guac), salads, tacos and such but your choices are limited for all of them.\n\nI went with the recommendation from another review of the queso with everything except chorizo for an app and 2 tacos rojas which were all vegetarian.  Another disappointment when both arrived at the same time.  The queso was mediocre at best.  It was very grainy and the extras of black beans and jalapenos were on top of a cheese crust rather than mixed in the queso.\n\nThe tacos were decent but nothing i would consider better than average.\n\nService is what caused this to be a 2 star review rather than a 3. Although there were 3 bartenders, only one seemed to be 'my' bartender but she disappeared and I didn't see her after one \"Are you ok here\".   Another bartender asked me if I wanted another beer but that was it...at that point I was ready to close my bill.  The 3rd one asked again if I needed another beer and I stated I was done and finally I received a check. Unfortunately at the time it was too late to make up for the other mistakes.\n\nSo if you like trendy places in trendy neighborhoods with limited parking, perhaps you would enjoy this one. But honestly, my other choice when i chose to stop here was Moe's down the street. After spending some time at Bakersfield, I wish I would have chose Moe's.  \n\nThis place seems to be popular with some of the locals but if you check their website, it appears they are yet another chain with their other locations in the midwest.  In order to survive here they need to be open to people over 40, improve their bar service and make their restaurant a destination where people will walk for  blocks to get there.

    "text": "13th Floor is part of a haunted house \"franchise\" that has a couple of other locations; the one in Denver is where it all started, and is a legend unto itself. If you visit the Denver website, you can view videos about the house, and you will see repeatedly that USA Today included 13th Floor in their list of \"Top 13 Haunted Houses in America.\"\n\nThe Arizona incarnation leaves something to be desired. Located in a rented-out strip mall in a seedy part of Bell Avenue, 13th Floor does not impress you from the get-go. What you do notice right away is the crowd of hundreds of people lined up to get inside and get spooked. I took this as a good sign, even though we showed up half an hour after they opened. \n\nBuy your tickets online if you can. There is a line of hundreds to get in the house, and a similar line for tickets as well. If you're a patient person, and you want some time to build up the anticipation and adrenaline by being surrounded by a ton of giddy and jumpy people, go for the lines. They have actors with chainsaws and creepy makeup pacing around, scaring the easy targets, posing for pictures, and giving you a preview of what's to come. \n\nThe actual haunted house is nothing special. If you've been to one before, you'll see it all again. You have actors in creepy makeup and clothing jumping out at you, slamming things against the wall or floor, and getting up in your face. There are rooms you're led through themed as grisly, defiled homes, kitchens, and hallways; there was a pirate-themed area, and a misty jungle to walk through. I was disappointed in the lack of jumps in that area; the scare potential among the close-pressing fog, bushes, and trees was great. (I wish I had been able to go through more slowly to admire the props and background setup; everything was something you've seen before, but it was beautifully set up. 13th Floor may not have scared me, but they get points for attention to detail.) \n\nOne thing that I'll admit I've never seen before was the usage of partially closed garage doors placed in strategic areas. Open only a foot or two from the floor, an actor would get a running start and slide on his knees out from under the door and then pop up next to you. The first time or two I saw this, it was downright hilarious; this does not seem to be an easy or very practiced thing for the actors to do, and some of them ate it or slammed into my legs like they were trying to take me out. (The actors are not supposed to/allowed to touch you.)\n\nI will admit that I'm not an easy person to scare. I'm not jumpy or unnerved by the dark, loud sounds, or people lunging at my face suddenly. (When you take care of a toddler all day, you develop a sort of Clint Eastwood hardness and eventually lose your flinching reflex.) There were, however, people all around me screaming their heads off in terror. One girl was even sobbing. If that isn't a testament to 13th Floor's fear factor, I don't know what is. \n\nThe fatal flaw of my visit was the fact that the event staff was not separating the groups for long enough time periods. Things cease to be scary when you're basically part of a continuous shuffling line of people. You're rushed, and you can see ahead of you what's about to pop out of that dark corner, because you just watched the group ahead of you deal with it. Our total time going through the house was 13 minutes. (Yes, I timed it.) \nWe paid $35 per person to get a VIP ticket, which gives you access to a much shorter line; regular admission is $25. Had I paid half that amount, I would have written this off as an unusual, fun activity to try out on a Saturday night. However, losing nearly forty bucks on this snooze stings. \n\nIf our group of 4 was alone, hearing only the distant screams of other people ahead of us, then I could up 13th Floor another star, rating it as A-Okay. As it stands now, however, my experience was thoroughly 2-star.",

That should have been handled two months ago at the dealership, but it was not.\nI had one person there, CJ in Finance, who has tried to help me over the last couple months with these issues. I do thank him for that... It seems, however, that whomever completes the paperwork is not doing it correctly. They are not getting it done timely. It is very discouraging to see the lack of attention to detail, especially after purchasing such a high end vehicle from this dealership.",

Sure, I know the breakfast is only 3 dollars, so I probably shouldn't be hard on it; but regardless of price, I'd still like my meal to be served hot and be put together with some level of care and attention.\n\nThis is a pretty mediocre breakfast here: a slice of warm ham, a strip of old bacon, browned toast, over/undercooked eggs, leftover potatoes, breakfast served here is less-than-spectacular, and the service staff doesn't seem to care if you complain about it; I'm sure they've heard it all countless times before.\n\nAll of this, of course, is served in one Toronto's prized possessions, High Park. If it wasn't for the location, I certainly would have given them 1 star. In fact, it wasn't for the location, I probably wouldn't have eaten there at all. And in some strange way, I almost wish I didn't eat there. That way, the ad on Bloor street could have remained some mystical promise of a tasty, hot, and friendly-served breakfast somewhere in the heart of High Park.",

While the express lines are good and efficient , I take issue with the whole old system and the manner that they treat passengers. The bus platforms are not accurately reflected in the two small screens placed up and far from eye sight. You most likely will need a magnifier. It's ridiculous considering the prices they charge and the service  being public. The washrooms are downstairs and in the two times I've used this method of transport , I found the escalator  shut down I felt for the elderly , disabled , mothers with children and baggage who had to wait for the small elevator or carry everything down and up the stairs. \nThe women's washrooms reeked every time and there were only 5 stalls one of which was closed for maintenance. Crappy for Toronto! If this was a less developed city in a less developed country I'd say okay they probably have a small budget.\n\nThe drivers are nice and the lines that I took were fast one took 2:20 from Toronto to London , the other time it took 2:50 for the same direct route but perhaps they account for traffic and such.

In addition, I didn't like two of the three cheeses that were served, and I can't say that has ever happened to me before.  Our friends ordered two entrees to share, scallops and lamb, and the server left before taking the order for the other half of the table.  We had to call our server back to order.  My boyfriend and I shared the sticky pork shank and sides of brussel sprouts and crispy fingerling potatoes.  I enjoyed the pork shank more than my boyfriend did and the brussel sprouts were not crispy like I would have preferred.  All in all, we could have prepared a better version of this meal at home.\n\nIf the food was amazing and the service lackluster, I may have been able to overlook the deficits of this restaurant.  However, when a shared meal costs over a hundred dollars (in Charlotte no less), I expect the food to wow me and the service to be up to standard.  As a former server in a Michelin star restaurant, I know what level of service to expect and what is unacceptable.  For example when spending $150 on dinner for two, I expect the silverware to not be placed in a pile with the napkins at the end of the table.\n\nUnfortunately, we will not be back to Stoke.",

The sangria is a rip off.\n\nThere were so many conflicting points regarding this trip to Olive Garden.  Great fast service, but a smelly restaurant.

The cakes did not come with sides. The preference would be a smaller portion of cakes served with at least one side. The maple syrup was cold. We asked to have it heated but their heating lamp must not be functioning properly because after 2 attempts the syrup was still very cold. \n\nLast, the online menu is not aligned with the actual menu.

The nice, friendly receptionist said that she was not sure and would have the technician contact me. A day or two (or three) later, I received an illegible inspection report via email.  I could not understand a thing on it. There were no details in the email, it was just the attached pdf. I replied asking for an explanation as to what the inspection report meant. I received an email back from Steve (the owner I presume) and he essentially said, \"your A/C unit is causing your tenants monthly power bill to increase. The cost of replacing it would be less than the cost of repairing it.  You need a new A/C.\" I replied and asked how much more the bill is than it should be and how is it even possible to measure that.  I also asked why, if I need a new A/C was I not informed of this back in March after the inspection. No response. I sent another email asking about the status of my questions.  No response.

Our waiter took at least 10 minutes just to come and take our order. It took an additional 35 minutes just to get our food. I understand the place is pretty busy, but they should already know the place will be packed on a Saturday night and have the correct amount of staff on hand. \n\n===Food===\n\nComplimentary bread and pretzels: The pretzels were in the shape of a breadstick, but they were perfectly chewy and soft. They serve the pretzel with a mustard cheese sauce and regular butter. I'd recommend going with the cheese sauce. The other bread that they served seemed to be some type of wheat bread with toasted seeds on top. Definitely not as good as the pretzels.\n\nBraised beef cheek: Served with mashed potatoes and broccoli rabe. This dish was very disappointing. The beef cheek itself didn't taste fresh. Think of when a fatty beef dish gets cold. You get that layer of oily white fat. It tasted and felt like that in my mouth which is not appetizing at all. Also the gravy was pretty bland. Not worth the $28. 2/5\n\nPan seared diver scallops: Braised artichokes, baby carrots, pearl onions in a white wine garlic broth. They give 4 scallops in this dish. It's not very filling at all since they don't give any type of carb with this dish. It could definitely use some risotto, mashed potatoes, pasta or anything that's a carb! $32. 2.5 stars\n\nOverall, I was sadly disappointed with this Gordon Ramsay location.

I knew it was going to be a busy weekend so I purchased reservations for 2 lounge chairs at the Voo Pool, $28 each, for Saturday. We checked in with the pool staff and we were taken to the chairs I had reserved. It was only 11:30 and there was hardly anyone there yet. So we waited a few minutes and a waitress never came over to us to get drink orders so my husband just got up and went to the bar. While my husband was doing that, the waitress finally came over. Before even indroducing herself she says \"ummm did you pay for these?\" And said \"yes, for these 2.\" She then says \"so, you gave one of the guys over there money for these??\" And I said \"no. I purchased them online. But I already checked in with one of the guys up there\". She then says \"oh. Well what can I get for you\". I told her my husband had already went to the bar but I'm sure we will be needed refills soon. She then walks away.\nAfter awhile, we were ready to order more drinks. She never came up to us.

    "text": "To start with, we went to the Food Truck Friday because this truck was going to be there. Coupled with another truck that we wanted to try, we talked about it for weeks! Keep in mind that I write these reviews not just to help the customers be wise consumers, but also so that business owners can get feedback from customers and gain insight into running their business in the most successful manner. With that said, I struggle with this review. The company has really been well marketed and over hyped! The truck is beautiful and as up to date as possible. The line was extremely long and it took quite a while for food to come out. While waiting in line I noticed that several people were complaining and returning food! I was honestly pretty worried at that point and tried to hear why they were coming back. The complaints were all the same. The lobster rolls they had ordered were supposed to be hot and that the lobster was cold. I asked one lady what was wrong with her food and she told me that it was ice cold in the middle. People were not complaining about the line to order. They were complaining about the wait for their food. There was a huge group of people waiting for food. Suddenly a woman appeared frantically trying to get into the truck's front door which was locked. She had Walmart bags in her arms. I said to my wife that she must have made a Walmart run for Lobster (We were in the parking lot for Sam's Club and next to the Walmart.) I was joking but I think she went to get bread. That's right my \"roll\" was on bread. I would say it was Texas Toast to be exact. So, it was my turn to order. The guy is taking orders from the window which is quite high, and I had trouble hearing him. He used a tablet to have me sign for my debit card. They ask for an optional tip which I find absurd when no one is doing anything worth tipping. They didn't bring my food and as a matter of fact I had to ask for a napkin and a fork. When I went back to get a knife the lady was very nice, but I still wouldn't say it was worthy of even more money. I must admit that I was taken back by the price. I know that lobster can be expensive, but this is extremely expensive for the size of roll you get. It is about double what I think it is worth. Our order did not take too long to get (about 8 minutes). I guess once the cook came back it was easier to pump out food. By the way I watched to see if she washed her hands and she did.  The man called our name over the loud speaker that is useless! I didn't see anyone else go to the window, so I figured it must be mine. Anyway, we got our food and I was shocked at how small it was. My wife and I always split food. I could eat three of these on my own! We each took our two bites and the Lobster is wonderful. It has a wonderful sweet flavor. There was a small line of mayo on the Texas toast that did not make much difference. I would double the mayo but that is me. It was lobster on bread. Well the wait was over and in two bites the meal was over. I looked at my wife and laughed. I said, \"well that was a big bubble buster!\" She said she thought the flavor was great but that the $20 we spent was not worth it. For the record the roll was $16.50 plus tax and tip. I felt a little robbed to be honest. I am the type of person that tips huge amounts for great service and doesn't mind paying a lot of money for quality food and service. In this case it was a bit much. Let's not forget this is a food truck. They don't even have the overhead of a brick and mortar restaurant! They must be making a killing off the name and notoriety, but it will not last for long because I can't imagine too many people will go twice. I know that I would never do it again. I love Shark Tank, and this is good quality lobster, but they better listen to their customers or they won't be around long. Overall, I rate them a 2. Quantity of food 1, Service 3, Price point 1, Quality of food 5.",

    "text": "Good food, dismal experience otherwise. \n\nI came in from out of town for New Year's to visit my sister and her boyfriend, who live in Henderson. They love Kabuki back from when they lived in So Cal. I wanted to treat them to a nice NYE meal, so we made reservations here, which were available on Open Table at 815, 830, and 845.\n\nOur reservations were for 815 but we were running 15 min late so I called ahead. I was assured it was no problem, though was also advised that they had \"last call\" for both food and drink at 845, which seemed odd since their last res was for 845. \n\nUpon our arrival, the hostess looked a bit put out and reminded us of the 845 \"last call\", but also assured us that we were welcome to stay in the restaurant as long as we liked so as to not feel rushed. We were quickly able to give our drink order and our server came by about 5 minutes later. We had to very quickly decide what our entire order would consist of, including all sushi/rolls, etc. This turned out fine, but I didn't appreciate having to order everything up front.\n\nOur server was polite, but it quickly became quite obvious that the restaurant staff were closing the restaurant down, to the degree that 15 minutes after having our food, our server was coming to get our soy sauce bottle \"out of the way\" - to which I objected as we were obviously still in the middle of dinner. He then dropped the bill off a very short time later. Having felt rushed from the moment we entered the restaurant, I asked to speak with the manager. She assured we could stay \"as long as we liked\", though didn't so much as offer any apology for our treatment - quite frankly, she was probably directing them to close as quickly as possible.\n\nThe 2-stars was because the food was quite good, otherwise it would've been one star. I don't understand for the life of me why a restaurant would advertise having reservations available on any night, let alone NY Eve, up until 845 when they're closing at 9pm - and won't offer any additional access to food or drink after 845. I haven't felt this unwelcome in a restaurant for years, if ever. Very disappointing experience for us all, and they've now lost my sister and her bf as customers as well.",

The Rick Bayless Everyday Mexican cookbook holds an esteemed spot in the kitchen, so I'll admit I set the bar pretty high when evaluating this style of cuisine.\n\nWe arrived at 5 pm and our server promptly took our drink order, but things started to slow down.  Despite having three servers working five tables, it took about 15 minutes to get our drinks and a small complimentary basket of chips.   Did I mention that the basket of chip was small?  Our party of four devoured them in three minutes, but no one came by to ask us if we wanted more.  (It should be noted that the first basket of chips was free, after that, you'll be charged $2 for a bottomless supply).  The chips were the star of the evening.  Hot, fresh with plenty of crunch.  I would make the trip to the west side just to get another fix.  The consistency of the salsa verde was a disappointment.  It was far too watery, making it difficult to get the right balance of salsa and chip.\n\nI also enjoyed the Quesadillas de Rajas y Queso we ordered as an appetizer.  The corn masa coating was cooked to perfection, but I would have preferred a Mexican cheese over the mozzarella used as the filling.  The roasted poblanos were excellent and a small serving of crema was a welcome addition to the dish.\n\nAfter a long wait (about 20 minutes) and only one refill of our basket of chips, we received the entrees.  I ordered one of the specials, a beef barbacoa based on the recommendation of the server.  The beef was tender, but a little under seasoned.  The dish was overpowered by a pile of raw onions that topped the beef.  I like onions, but these gave the dish a sulphery aftertaste.  The sides also were disappointing, the re-fried beans were overcooked and lacked texture, the Mexican rice was mushy and bland.  With the little more focus on the details, this could have been a great meal.\n\nThe kids ordered cheese enchiladas and chicken enchiladas. The salsa verde lacked punch.  The tomatillos really needed to be roasted longer to give the green sauce more depth.  The chicken was well cooked but under seasoned and I was frustrated with the the use of mozzarella as the filling for the cheese enchiladas.  There are some great Mexican melting cheeses that could have vastly improved this dish.\n\nAfter another long wait, we finally received the bill which totaled $65 before tip for our group of four.  The meal cost was reasonable, but I can't really recommend La Mestiza given the below quality of the food and service I experienced.",

I am not willing though to rate to a higher level as this dinner on many levels fell flat. I should have known, but kept my hopes up none the less. My husband and I were invited to a date night dinner here, so we went along for the ride.\n\nFirst off, service was a tad better this time around. Our waiter was a bit of an odd-ball though. I have to give him props for getting me a cocktail in just in time for the Happy Hour price. He was also incredibly knowledgeable about the restaurant's extensive menu. Happily telling us all kinds of things, including his opinion of the Marsala sauce that is very unlike his Italian grandmothers.\n\nAppetizers:\n\nCalamari Fritte, served with marinara. It was fried Calamari. Luckily though it was not soggy or gross. It was fried up nicely and with a spritz of lemon and a bit of the sauce was a decent app. \n\nSpinach & Artichoke Al Forno - I am a fan of artichokes in apps. My favorite though it basically just grilling the artichoke and serving it to me as is. However, I was not impressed with this dip. It is baked in an Asiago and Alfedo-like cheese sauce and it just did not have any zing to make it any better than any other spinach dip I have had.\n\nCrab & Shrimp Cannelloni ($18.50) - Ugh! What a waste of money. This dish came out in a POOL of cheese sauce. Literally, the entire plate was cheese sauce. The menu description says this, \"Asiago cheese sauce and breadcrumbs\". No. There were no breadcrumbs. My plate was a goopy pile of cheese sauce, with three lone Cannellonis that had, perhaps, 4-5 pieces of shrimp. The peppers included did not enhance the meal one bit. The cannelloni was soggy and unappetizing and the crab meat inside was like a wet mop, just smooshy and gross. I was incredibly disappointed in this dish.\n\nI wish I had gotten the Spaghetti and Meat Sauce, which is what my husband got, and he cleaned his plate!\n\nCreme Brulee ($7.95) - A huge portion of creme brulee served in a trough. Okay, I'm just kidding it wasn't served in a trough, but it might as well have been. The dessert portions are large, so ya know, share. My husband had one spoonful of the creme brulee and I was left to eat the rest of it.\n\nAgain, as an overall opinion - it's over-priced, over-salted, overly-hyped Italian food on The Strip. It's a chain Italian restaurant I will continue to avoid.",

    "text": "This place was a disappointment overall. I've eaten at lots of Brazilian Churrascaria restaurants and this one by far was my worst experience. We found this restaurant through advertisement of a timeshare and were given \"free\" tickets for dinner. Upon arrival they were pretty busy but none the less we were seated pretty quickly within about 5 mins so that was great. However once we were seated we noticed all 4 glasses on table were nasty as if they hadn't been washed. We immediately asked for new glasses and pointed out a lipstick stain on one of the glasses. We were told it was because the cups were plastic and hard to clean. She returned about 5 mins later with 2 actual glasses this time which were again dirty. We just took them and decided to wait for waiter. After waiting about 10-15 mins our waiter finally made it. So we asked again about getting some clean cups or glasses to drink out of, he wasn't apologetic at all about the dirty glasses and still poured water into the dirty glasses as if we would still drink it after we had asked for clean glasses, so I reminded him they were nasty. We presented the tickets and he explained that we would need to pay additional $10 each to get the entire salad bar and all the meat service. So we agreed because we wanted to get the total experience, as well I ordered a sprite(that never came). The salad bar was subpar, some items were out and there were not very many to start with. The salad area is very small and crowded, and as soon as we arrived at the bar there were angry customers addressing the manager about the poor selection and some items being out for over 45 mins. The manager apologized to the people complaining and said they had a few new trainees in the kitchen and they couldn't keep up with the crowd that night. We returned to our seats and the meat service started. They seemed to mostly only have sirloin steak and a roast like cut of beef, we asked about filet mignon and we were told they didn't have it. The also had a grilled ham, chicken, lamb and other pork items. We asked for our meat to be medium well so we were served our meat on a saucer they brought from the back with about 3 thinly sliced pieces of meat instead of it being carved at the table. Pros of the visit were the sautéed mushrooms on the salad bar, the grilled pineapples which were delicious and the meat servers. Cons everything else about the visit.

I think the atmosphere is pretty cool. It's very different compared to most PGH South Hills eateries.  There were these huge garage doors that I assume will be opened in the warmer months but it did make it very chilly. I'm happy I had my coat to wear during lunch. \n\nThe beers were very cool (a bit expensive but that's expected). The descriptions of the beers were on point! I think we tried all but 1 because they didn't have it available. I could easily crave some of these beers.\n\nThe food was lacking. I think the owners need to focus more on getting the customers substance in their food. For example, we ordered the cheese platter ($14). The platter came with 3 small pieces of toasted bread, scattered walnut bits that no one know what to do with, a few jumbo olives, and some standard cheeses. We asked for more toasted bread and about 10 minutes later, we got 4 more pieces. There were 5 of us - An appetizer that is over $9 should be able to feed more than 3 people.   They were also out of anything pretzel which was a letdown (understandable since this is still a new business). \n\nMy pizza was pretty amazing though! All of the pizzas sounded delicious - the ingredients were very fresh. Something that was off was that each additional topping was $2?? It's just not worth it here. It's really not. The rest of the table ordered sandwiches. Synopsis, nothing to write home about. The chips they give you on the side seemed like they were from a bag. The ones my boyfriend got seemed like they came from the bottom of the bag. When everyone was done eating, we all said we could definitely eat more. This also goes back to the substance point I made. \n\n I'm not sure if this place wants the customers to leave more room for the beer or not? If that's the case then they need to lower the food prices. This place needs some time to figure out how to be \"cool/urban\" while also catering to the area. We like to eat, a lot!  I like that they have different options outside of usual wings, mozzarella sticks and fried zucchini selection that are a staple of the South Hills, but don't cheat us!

    "text": "I decided to give BBJ's another try and brought a friend for a Friday lunch catch-up session. Other than a couple of people sitting at the bar, we were the first people in the restaurant. When we left, the restaurant still didn't strike me as particularly busy. My friend and I both ordered fish tacos, which were one of the specials of the day. I requested a side salad rather than the chips and salsa: yes, I'm one of those pesky substitution-requesting people (my request was accommodated without hesitation or irritation). The salad looked appetizing, but since it was delivered without any silverware, I set it to the side and ended up taking it home (we asked for silverware when our entrees arrived, which was the next time that we saw a restaurant employee nearby). As a side note, I'm not sure whether the person who brought our entrees and silverware, and who then kindly boxed up my salad for me and brought the bill was the owner or manager, but he was far more helpful and friendly than our waitress, who never even refilled our water glasses (though she did check in to see that our food had arrived okay). \n\nThe fish tacos were disappointing, to say the least. The fish itself had been fried in a crispy but flavorless batter. The majority of the real estate on the three flour tortillas, though, was occupied by lettuce, tomatoes, and a few strands of cheese. Lemon wedges rounded out the plate. (The fact that the dish was intended to be served with chips and salsa is duly noted.) Although we both attacked the fish with a salt shaker and our lemons, the dish was still very one-note. It really needed bite from onions, jalapenos--anything to make it not...well, BLAND. As it was, we ended up putting tartar sauce on our tacos. Yes, really. \n\nOn the up-side, the meal was quite reasonably priced: in fact, I don't believe BBJ's charged me for the substitution, which I fully expected them to do. But, in the final analysis, it took me over 2 years to try BBJ's again after my initial visit. After being completely underwhelmed again, I feel very confident in saying that I won't be making further attempts to enjoy a place that seems like it should be a local gem, but comes up short.",

Also, if you're into basketball as much as me, there are always 5 on 5 pick-up games going on at this location during the weekdays which are pretty fun. There's also a One Stop Nutrition and a Subway in the same parking lot as the place which is great for people looking to eat healthy before/after gym time.\n\nNow...onto why I am giving this LA Fitness location 2 stars...one of my family members had their car broken into here just a few months ago. Some person straight up shattered the glass and grabbed a backpack and took off. Of course, nothing of value was in the bag, but this location is probably in one of the rougher areas of town. It's because the light rail runs along Camelback next to the gym where there are cop cars there every other week addressing problems. There's always homeless people hanging out outside the Frys and McDonalds next door. One time I even saw two kids barely 10 years old standing outside of the entrance to the gym begging people for money. All of this plays into the customer experience as gym members. LA Fitness management simply won't do anything about it either, even if you ask or leave feedback-which I guess is expected seeing as how this is a corporate joint. \n\nIt's an awesome facility that I will continue to give my business to simply because there aren't any other options nearby that beat this on amenities-but if you lived near 20th St. & Camelback or near McCormick Ranch in Scottsdale, I'd go to those LA Fitness gyms if you were looking for an optimal experience.

The ease of making the reservations online lead me to believe that the evening would be a smooth and enjoyable. \n\nUnfortunately that evening my husband was held up at work and we were about an half an hour later than our reservation. The host at the restaurant did a wonderful job seating our party and starting the meal as we had texted the family explaining our situation. Even upon our arrival, the servers were very helpful in getting my husband and me seated. As the meats were circulated to our table my husband and I had to continually catch the servers attention. Being a slightly larger party of eight, I did not think that was a number that would allow members to be overlooked. After about 45 minutes it seems the font of house manager noticed our issue and was very helpful sending servers to us and even asking if we were waiting for something particular.  But due to our later arrival as the rest of our party were enjoying conversation and the market bar, the meat stopped arriving along with all servers. They all seemed to have migrated to a different portion of the restaurant. \n\nThe other issue I had with the evening was that all the meat except the steak was very dry and over cooked. As our reservation was at 6pm, I can't imagine this was because the meat had cooked too long during service. It was a Thursday evening with I'm sure slower traffic than a weekend, but I would have thought the kitchen would be aware of how many reservations and on average how much of which dishes move during an evening and would adjust accordingly. Sadly to say that does not seem to be the case as chicken, pork, and even sausage were all dry and over cooked. \n\nThe bottom line is that I left an all you can eat restaurant hungry.

But i don't recommend ordering the quesadilla, it's a pretty simple dish, but they found a way to mess it up, the cheese was a bit odd, and the frijoles and arroz was very bland, no flavor what so ever. The pico de gallo had some flavor, also you have to pay for your chips and salsa here, but at a traditional Mexican restaurant it's not common where you pay for the chips and salsa.",

I'm patient, but we were not looked after. \n\nI ordered the ravioli, with fig, oyster and mushrooms and thought it was disappointing. It was not as good as I expected, entirely uninteresting presentation. I could not taste fig or oyster.

Until that fated day we must rely on the tiny aisles of major stores or alter our routines to suit the non-committal hours of your local indie grocer. \n\nOnce again, Whole Foods fails to satisfy the expectations of an average lady (or man) looking to up the nutrition in their meals and maybe even lower the harsh chemicals unknowingly injected in their body on a daily basis. For the faux-hippies, you can find rows and rows of overlit aisles containing and heavy packaged food products (I saw a single passionfruit dolled up in layers of plastic). \n\nFor those still interested in venturing out to Whole foods, take note:\n- All produce is priced and weighted at 100 grams, setting the price, for example of organic bananas at 3 times the price of the very same at Loblaws. (Try one bite of an all-natural banana at Big Carrot http://www.yelp.ca/biz/the-big-carrot-natural-food-market-toronto, I guarantee you'll never be the same ) \n- There are rows of beauty products, but I did not see the extremely coveted (and my personal favourite) Dessert Essence Jojoba Oil anywhere.\n- Zico Water is sold here at $4 and $1.49 at Loblaws. (Same size, brand and Flavour)  \n-They sell disposable dishware. I mean really? There are still innumerate issues with biodegradable anything. \n  \nI personally prefer my local indie grocer (See: Ambrosia http://www.yelp.ca/biz/ambrosia-natural-foods-thornhill#query:big%20carrot) for Vegetarian, organic and/or environmentally 'safer' products, however, this trip to Whole Foods has changed my opinion of Loblaws for the better. \n \nWhole foods seems to have found their target demographic in a blissfully unaware shopper with less care for the environment and more about  funding a desired personal image.",

There is another Viet restaurant 400m away next to T&T supermarket, and at the time I write this ANOTHER Viet restaurant is opening soon only 200m away in an adjacent strip mall.\n\nThe first indicator that this place is going to be sub-standard may be observed before food arrives at the table: the bowls of Pho are available in one size only. Its weird, but in my experience Viet places that dont have S, M, and L are gonna be lousy. Weird but true.\n\nSo, my one size fits all Pho was warm (NOT hot), oily, and really lacking in flavour. Plus, it was just plain over priced at around $8.  My friends submarine was not BAD, but not remarkable either. Just average, and again slightly overpriced.\n\nIts a Vietnamese restaurant, right? Well when I was there, an awkward white guy brought the food to the table har har har! If you get a pot of tea (free at REAL Viet places) it will set you back a couple dollars here.\n\nI personally wont return, but I do wish the owners luck. Being one of three Viet restaurants within 400m of each other means you are going to have to be either extraordinary with your food and service, or have extraordinary prices.

The store is an interesting place to mill around in if you're waiting for a table, but items are overpriced.  The dining area is kind of cool, if you like feeling like you're eating in a barn.  I have had the chicken pot pie once, and from what I can remember it was tasty, but every time I've been there and asked for it since, it's always been sold out.  As far as other dishes, I don't know what to say because I don't know how to feel about entrees that tastes like nothing.  All of the sides are bizarre, shellacked under a layer of margarine or oil they exhibit that fresh-from-the-can taste.  Everything seems artificial -Should I be eating this?

The food itself was very mediocre. The pulled chicken and pulled pork tasted like it sat in water all day, but was tender. The green beans were seasoned a bit but were very rubbery. The potato salad tasted like the kind you buy at the grocery store in the plastic containers. The baked beans were good. The mac and cheese wasn't too bad. The cornbread was very sticky like it wasn't cooked all the way or sat in moisture too long. All in all we probably won't go back here. The wait and the price are not worth the food you get.

So I set the appt for that day in which the stylist had an appt avaliable.  When I arrived a few minutes before my appt. I was bothered by someone else's child that was getting their hair done (which in most salons, children are not allowed unless being serviced) so that was an instant draw back considering when most people are getting serviced in a salon they would like a serene environment. Anyways, as time went by I noticed an hour pass the time my appt was for, I asked how much longer (considering I had an appt and expected to be serviced at the time of my appt scheduled)  I was told it would be 5 more mins. I continued to wait and it ended up being an hour and half by the time I was seated (unacceptable when you have an appt scheduled), by that time it ended up being even longer because someone that walked in after me was being shampoo-ed before me (how the heck does that work)! So I felt like my service was not appreciated and I left after waiting an hour and a half n(which was more than patient).

Service is okay and the store could be a bit cleaner.\n\nMy other critique is about their daily specials promotion. These promos appear cheap but are not good as they sound (obviously). Take the tuesday special for example - 2 felafels for the price of 1. They will use only two felafels instead of three per sandwich and use other condiments sparingly as well. I understand that this is a marketing tactic but it's misleading for sure.",

    "text": "UPDATE: After being contacted by David the Manager who was more than accommodating to try and fit me in for a new set at \"no charge\". I opted for a refund because the last thing I'd want is to sit through the process once again to only have the same issue occur. However, I was told they do not offer refunds at their salon being how the lash artist work off commission and is paid weekly. So I decided to just somehow get my money's worth and schedule another appt. to re-do my lashes. At time of appt. I was still charged a $40 difference for the volume set. When volume is what should have been done the first time around and whichever set was put on initially didn't even last a few days. For all the inconvenience as is you would think they would have just waived the $40 difference. I didn't want to hassle and just happily paid the difference.  Only hoping that this time around it would be done correctly. I was fortunate enough to be booked with Kayu who was very sweet and listened to my concerns and what I wanted as far as length prior to beginning.The result came out definitely a whole lot better than the first time but was still a bit all over the place. David, Kayu and staff are all very nice wonderful people. However, after redoing my lashes last Thursday only being 4 days passed since then so many has fallen off again. So I'm pretty much back at the same spot. With the same problems as stated above only with longer lashes this time around. As much as I wanted to love this place because the staff is great I even ended up getting a mani pedi that day as well because I was a having a guilty conscience about leaving such a terrible review. I should have just listened to my gut and took a lost for this one and not have gone back.. I still stand where I stand.. Great staff, Poor quality lashes... Will not be back.. Updated pics:",

    "text": "I have been a customer of Tin Tin since it was built way way many many years ago.  And throughout the years, it's been pretty consistently good.  I always crave the soup noodles but I don't know if it's worth it anymore..\n\nLast week, I was home for spring break and of course we went to Tin Tin to satisfy my noodle craving.  We got there, and we waited for about 20 minutes until we were seated - not a bad wait for 7pm on a Saturday night.  \n\nIn the past, my parents always complained how the waitresses couldn't speak english and didn't smile or ask about how we were doing.  This time around, however, our waitress was very friendly and fluent in english - both pleasant surprises.  \n\nSo the night was off to a great start.  But then! (dun dun dun!) I found a piece of plastic in the beef/noodle stirfry. We told the waitress and asked to see the manager.  The waitress apologized many times but the manager failed to show up for 10 minutes.  Now, usually if something like this happens, then my expecation is that the manager comes over as soon as he or she is free, apologizes, and then usually offers some sort of compensation.  So I was just sitting there for what felt like forever (although it was only 10 minutes), watching him stand at the podium idly, checking the seating list at times and calling people over.  I think that is a job that the hostess can do herself while you leave for two minutes.  Furthermore, when he came, he looked at the piece of plastic and apologized in a \"sorry not sorry\" tone without any offer of a discount for our meal.  Knowing that this would be my last visit, I ordered one last bowl of noodles.  Goodbye yummy noodles forever.. \n\nFor the amount you pay for this food, go somewhere fancy downtown.  For being part of the SERVICE industry, they (the managers, not the waitress I had) suck at service.  \n\nSo we paid, we left, and we won't ever be going back.\n\n#saltycustomer",

    "text": "I was traveling through this area when my car wouldn't start. It just so happen to be close by in the Harris Teeter parking lot. One of their customers recommended this Firestone. Since it was close and the tow truck wouldn't have to go far, I reluctantly chose to come here which I regret now. \n\nFirst of all, I consider myself a mechanic too but being out of state with no tools and no machine to read the codes to tell me why my car wouldn't start, I trusted this place. \n\nThey stated they would have to do diagnostic test and said it would be $59. However, the service advisor came back later and said it would be $99 for a full diagnostic test. \n\nTroubleshooting the problem: After a couple hours, they called me to the desk and said i would need the following:\n\nStarter\nBattery\nFuel Pump\nFuel Filter \nVacuum Line\n\nI thought to my self, there's no way all those auto parts went bad at the same time on my car. They gave me a price of $229 for the battery. I told them I can buy it at Advance Auto Parts for $169. So,  I bought it at Advance and brought it back and put it in myself. However, I had someone else to check battery and they said all it needed was a slow charge.  The mechanic said that my starter was \"fried\" which the manager agreed was not very professional words used by the mechanic. I didn't believe anything was wrong with my starter. So, I told them to just put the fuel pump, fuel filter and vacuum line on and we will see if it will start up afterwards. For these 3 parts and labor they gave a price of over $1204. \n\nMy investigation:  I called up a neighbor Firestone in Fort Mill and the woman gave a me price of $584.87 for the fuel pump, fuel filter and labor. Why is the price so far apart in difference.  I questioned the manager about the call I made to Fort Mill Firestone and told him the woman gave me a price of $584.87. He said \" can't be\". I repeated myself and said I just called them and that's the price she gave me. Again, he says \"can't be\" while shaking his head. I felt like he just called me a liar.  I also called up some other repair shops and they were a lot cheaper too. Most prices were in the upper $550 to $590 range including a Firestone in Cleveland, Mississippi. \n\nAnother price difference:  I called up Advance Auto Parts and they gave me a price of $269 for the fuel pump which has the fuel filter with it included. Yet, this Firestone want to charge me about $450 just for that fuel pump. This is not a parts house. They buy their parts from places like Advance, Autozone and etc then add a markup to that price.\n\nFinal Thoughts:  Yes, I know I helped their profit here big time. I trusted them. I will never use any Firestone in the Carolinas again. I just feel like I was done wrong. I didn't need no starter. It cranked up fine after they put the fuel pump on. And I didn't need no battery either.",

They did not screw up my order but my friends so I am going to add that in as a cumulative review.\n\nThe place is clean and typical korean restaurant with banchan. The kimchi was good and I was glad they had the potato mayo mash. Mhmm, because some places don't offer it.\n\nI ordered their spicy pork with rice and my friend ordered spicy beef soup and requested to have it without egg because she's slightly allergic. Unfortunately, they missed a bit of the egg white so she noticed it and told them. For mine, the spicy pork was not gochujang-ed enough so it was mild for my taste. I couldn't order my regular gamjatang because it was nice weather outside and i'll sweat if i order soup. Next time, I will order gamjatang and give this place another try.",

The matcha icecream did not taste like matcha at all. The lychee candy tasted decent by itself but does not pair well with the icecream. The cotton candy kept falling down and made it extremely difficult to eat the dessert altogether. You pretty much have to finish all the cotton candy before you can get to the icecream - which did not taste good to me either. Overall, their dessert looks nice in photos but did not impress me in flavour or quality at all.",

    "text": "One of my dreams was to experience the taste of true Wagyu ribeye beef directly imported from Japan. Well I did and to be honest it wasn't all that I anticipated to be especially for 6oz and 180$. First off the steak was served in 2 pieces. 1 piece was 3 oz and supposedly a section of the ribeye and the other 3 oz piece was the fat cap. I was skeptical about the fact that a chef would serve such a delicate piece of meat decomposed into 2 parts especially one of that quality in this case it was supposedly grade A5. Nevertheless I went with the flow. In my opinion 1 of the 2 pieces of beef was not Wagyu ribeye but rather some other cut of beef. The fat ratio was not present and the 3oz ribeye was not tender. The \"fat cap\" piece was indeed Wagyu quality which I thoroughly enjoyed but the ribeye portion was not. I was disappointed but I didn't let that ruin my experience. The service was fantastic, the best I ever had. Both waiters were attentive and very knowledgeable. The reason why I am giving this 2 stars regardless of the poor food quality is the following, as my friend and I reviewed our 528$ bill for the evening I noticed a random $2 charge listed as a Sauce. I did ask the server to bring me a side of the House sauce but didn't expect he would charge me for it. Not a big deal, I can afford $2 it's the principle that counts. When I asked him about it and told him that I think it was kind of ridiculous that I am being charged an extra $2 for the house steak sauce, the comment was \" that's absolutely right, $2 for the sauce\". With that said I graciously paid my bill thanked my server for the wonderful experience and reduced his tip from 20% to 15%.",

I walked in for a soda with my 3 year old daughter and was immediately approached by the older woman who wears her hair in a ponytail (forgot to get her name but she is there often) and berated for \"stealing somebody's gas on 4/08/15! I told her I absolutely did NOT and I can tell her exactly what happened. On that day I drove up to the pump and immediately noticed there was already somebody's info on there and the screen already said to \"remove nozzle and choose gas\" so I pressed CANCEL and MADE sure the screen had the welcome screen before proceeding to swipe my debit card, enter my pin and start pumping. The pump stopped me at $11.66 and a man came out of the station telling me they had put his gas on my pump. I KNEW I hadn't used his money because I had obviously just swiped my card and entered my info so I then left. \n\nWhen I came in today 4/15/15 and was approached rudely by this employee I brought up the charge on my account on my phone and showed it to her and another employee PROVING that I had paid for that $11.66 worth of gas! She still didn't believe me! I frequent this gas station (at least a few times a week) but I think I am done going here and will go to QT or Frys down the street. Her attitude should have ended when I showed her the charge on my bank account but she continued to be rude. \n\nNOT A HAPPY CUSTOMER.

My friend picked out this place, and considering she is a vegetarian, and she doesn't eat meat, it's surprising that she would pick a place that has no alternatives to meat. \n\nMy main problem is that there was a short hair, or an eyelash on my Scallops app. It was on the plate, not in the actual food, but not appetizing. I didn't like the broth it came in, not very tasty. The scallops were great! But, when I found the eyelash or hair, I asked our waiter (who was beyond nice), to take it away, and he said he would take care of it. Unfortunately, having run into another restaurant (Milestones) that had a piece of plastic in my food, they said they would take care of it, as in my bill. But I was BILLED for my app. I told them I wasn't paying for it, and they took it off. \n\nFor my main course, I ordered the lamb. I asked for well-done, I got PINK lamb. I asked them for a refire, and they did, but when they brought it back, it was still red (more red in other areas). \n\nFor dessert, I got creme brulee (vanilla, chocolate, mocha x 2, I didn't want the ginger).

It was about 5:30 on a Saturday evening and I had just finished running some errands.  I saw the Panda Express and thought that would be a good option since I have been experiencing a medical issue and I am not supposed to be on my feet for too long.  I pulled in and took a quick glace at my options.  When the server came up to take my order she acted as if she could care less.  I asked for string bean chicken but upon close look it appeared as if it had been sitting there for most of the afternoon.  I said to her \"those beans do not look good\"  Her response was \"do you still want it?\"  Really??  No, no and no!  I got the broccoli beef instead but it was not much better upon tasting it when I got home.  I also got the honey walnut shrimp. The coating was rubbery, not crisp, which would indicate to me that most of the food had been sitting around for some time.  The server should have asked if I would like to wait while they made a fresh batch.  That would have been good customer service.  Instead she got my order together, rang it up, and that was that. No thank you or anything.  And there was one other person being waited on while I was there.  It was not as if they were swamped with people.  Sorry but I'm not sure I will be going back to this particular location.  There are others near me that have done a far better job.

    "text": "2 stars because IF I was looking to buy a Wrangler, JL, or Cherokee, they have a large inventory to choose from, however, I went in looking for a Renegade Trailhawk of which they had ONE in the whole store. Luckily, I came to see just that one. I had already looked at it online.\n\nI show up, begin to head inside, and am met by a salesperson (Sean, from Michigan) who promptly runs to meet me before I enter the showroom. Immediately I inform him of which vehicle I came to look at and he quickly obliges by bringing a golf cart to the front for us to drive to the vehicle.  \n\nWe get to the Trailhawk and the sticker price is priced about $2k higher than online. I inform Sean of this, and he takes a minute to look at the website, confirms what I said, and lets me know that they would honor the online price. The sticker price contradicting the online price was a little off putting. What if I hadn't checked online first? So, we get in the Jeep, Sean drives it to the gas station to fill up and lets me know that I am fine to go ahead and get into the driver's seat.\n\nI move over to the driver's seat. Meanwhile, he is paying for the gas, and as Im sitting there, Im looking around checking everything out. The first noticeable mishap was a scratch on the interior door. I mention it to him and he brushes it off as just residue that will wash off. Umm, no, it was clearly NOT just residue, nevermind that I already saw him scratch the tint with the seatbelt buckle. \n\nAs Im looking around more, I can't help but think that this 2018 vehicle with 4 miles on it, literally looks like it has been 'used.' It was dirty and there was trash in the door, I guess from a previous test drive? It just wasn't presentable at all. Sean made sure to mention that it had been on the lot for about a month and that usually cars don't stay on the lot that long. Okay, sooo, why is THIS one still there?\n\nThen, comes the nitty gritty part of car buying, the money and the numbers. BEFORE I even indicate whether or not I actually want to proceed with the purchase, Sean insists that I hurry and fill out the credit application. I promptly put things on hold, informing him that we needed to talk a liiiittle bit more about the exact details before we go any further.\n\nAfter honoring the online price and offering $5k for my trade in, I let him know that the offer on the trade in just won't work at all. Good thing I did ample research before coming in because I was well aware that EVEN as a trade in, my vehicle was worth at least $7k. So after a bit of back and forth and him leaving to ask the manager, we settle on $6500. \n\nNext, was time to talk about financing and down payment. Luckily, they didn't really give me any hassle on wanting to go through my own third party broker for financing, but once we started talking about down payment, the conversation took a pretty crazy turn. \n\nI insisted that I wanted to put a down payment to lower the financed amount. I let Sean know, that I wanted to pay in cash, not check, of which I would have to go and get. He informs me that he doesn't think they can take cash as a down payment. So funny because the dealership I ended up buying from, let me pay using my debit card (same as cash).\n\nSo, we went from first, putting a down payment to, we don't take cash, can you write a check to, how about you don't put a down payment AT ALL to, okay we CAN take cash to, why do you have to go and GET the cash, can't your boyfriend just bring it to you?\n\nAt this point, I realize that this is all going way wrong. For one, I am, in not so many words, somewhat being held hostage (they have the keys to my trade in, of which I had to ask for when I began heading towards the exit). I'm asked not to leave to get my down payment, THEN, Sean begins grasping at straws to get me to proceed with filling out the credit app. I oblige just to get him to stop hassling me. Deciding that I'm really not into this particular Trailhawk, I ask if there's any way they can keep an eye out on a white one for me instead.\n\nSean tells me they CAN'T keep an eye out for a white one and continues trying everything in his power to get me not to leave, even after we discussed that I wanted to go get cash. I finally am allowed to leave but only if I promise to be back in 45 minutes, nevermind, the place I need to go is across town (It was about 5pm and he wanted an exact time of how long it would take for me to get the money). It was very awkward. He informs me that while I'm gone, they'll go ahead and run my app, and I beg them to hold off until I get back. \n\nObviously at this point, Im NOT coming back. Had Sean not been so pushy, and not forthcoming regarding the fact that they COULD have looked out for a white Trailhawk for me, (he later back peddled over text, and told me they could make it happen) I may have proceeded with my purchase here. But, I ended up going to a competitor, which turned out to be the better deal for me.",

You get the soup, you are served ravioli (you get a fork though) and you get the same toaster strudel everyone else gets.  You just have to tell your server once you're seated you're a vegetarian to get this meal and it took a bit longer than the others getting hens to come out.\n\nWe booked our tickets early (we were booking Cirque for the same trip and for those shows it's needed) and I'm sure we were the first to book because we could have sat anywhere.  We choose front row in the middle of Dragon.  I was worried about eating so close to horses but that wasn't a problem at all.  Sitting in the front made great seats be we were the last to be fed pretty much.  I'd recommend sitting closer to the center and avoid the ends of the arena (unless you really want to cheer for a certain country in that area)\n\nOver all the show was pretty cool.   I didn't understand when booking dragon doesn't do any of the competing in the games and is more of the antagonist.   That means you're sitting in the bulk of the show with no one to cheer on (even in the start).  As an adult that is ok...  I took a while to figure out we didn't have a king at all. I'm not sure how ideal that section is for the kids.   You do get to cheer for the villain that has pyrotechnics who's pretty awesome a bit later on though so maybe that has extra draw to the kids. \n\nI like the show. It's light hearted and fun with some extra pizzazz.  It's interactive and you can be a bit silly.  It's not my favorite show but it's pretty good.  Likely the best family show I've seen in Vegas. \n\nMy food sucked though... the soup was ok as was the dessert but the vegetarian ravioli was gross.  VERY over cooked, soggy, and bland.   I didn't finish my small serving because I almost threw up in my mouth due to texture issues.   They serve you pop that's been sitting in pitchers for I don't know how long so it's completely flat by the time it gets poured into your glass.  For that reason I wish I had ordered from the expensive bar over drinking flat soda waiting for the water that was never to arrive.   My fiance barely got through his hen saying it was just ok.   Dessert was alright and helped alleviate the left over ravioli in my mouth that was driving me crazy. \n\nService was acceptable.  Our server was mostly a bus boy in reverse - don't talk to him because he's not interest.  At least the food arrived and the dishes disappeared.  The section was served faster than many of the others to at least he had a system.  \n\nFor mom and dad there are some cute kings and saucy wenches that like to dance and sing.   The horses are gorgeous and the games are fun to watch.   I'm sure much of that is theatrical tricks due to just how dangerous some of those actions they were taking really were back in the day but I couldn't figure it out myself.\n\nIf there is an option to skip food i'd do that... but I'd recommend the show to people thinking it might be their kind of thing to do in Vegas.",

    "text": "This is really a 3.5 star review.\n\nThey have a wonderful selection of high end restaurants, and there are acres of casino, but I just can't give it 4 stars, and well, it's not a 5 star place.  The rooms are nice, but you can tell that it's been there a while.  The cleaning service was really varied, as sometimes they folded the towels well, and sometimes they didn't. Sometimes the beds were made well, and sometimes not.  The shower had mediocre water pressure, and the elevators had 1 shaft in each tower that made me edgy to get into.  I actually ended up in 1 in each area visiting friends that proved this theory true, but the one in my section would have all of the buttons just turn off if pressed in an odd sequence, so people kept missing their floors.  Very frustrating.  The buffet is mediocre, giving some variety, but not really impressing me.  I also have issues with a place that doesn't have at least $10 tables, but maybe I'm just cheap.\n\nThose were the reasons it isn't a 5 star hotel.  Here are the pros...\nThe casino has really clean bathrooms.  The selection of restaurants and celebrity chefs is staggering.  The Joel Robuchon restaurants are my favorite places anywhere, so that has to elevate it to begin with.  The Cirque du Soleil show, KA is stunning.  I highly recommend it.  Studio 54 is only so-so, but it's open every night, so you always have a place to dance, even if it isn't the hottest place to go.  The bedding is really nice at this hotel. It keeps up with the amazing bed idea.  I like the roundness of different bars they have. All of them are very inviting, and make you feel conected to the casinos.",

    "text": "So my search for the perfect cupcake took me to Sweet Thang. Cute space, friendly staff, nice selection of teas, and the fact that they have a five minute lunch menu sets them apart. But the cupcakes do not.\n\nI will say that these were better cupcakes in comparison to some of their peers, however I am still baffled at how this has become the holy grail of sweet treats. The one constant between the four flavors that I sampled were that they were at least sort of moist. But flavorful, meh, not so much. I tried the chocolate, carrot, lemon, and caramel. \n\nSo here is the breakdown on the little cakes:\n1) The chocolate is (duh) chocolate cake with a chocolate/raspberry  mouse filling and topped with ganache. The cake was dark like chocolate, but pretty dull in flavor. The filling was there, but not discernable enough to stand out as a flavor unto itself. And the ganache was more like dry chocolaty icing. IMO, not really worth the calories.\n2) The caramel is a butter cake (think yellow) filled with caramel mouse and topped with a light caramel frosting. The cake was a pretty standard yellow cake. The filling was again so mild in flavor that there really wasn't much point in its being there. The frosting, described as mildly flavored, was more of an understatement. I really think it was white frosting with a light glazing of caramel underneath. IMO, really not worth the calories or the price. \n3)The carrot is filled with cream cheese mouse and topped with cream cheese frosting. At least this one resembled it's description, but I wasn't blown away.\n4) The lemon is a lemon cake, filled with lemon chiffon, and topped with lemon frosting. This was the closest thing to decent in the half dozen that I took home. I couldn't detect any lemon in the cake, but the filling almost had a hint of tartness and the frosting actually had some zest mixed in (which is what I would expect).\n\nI will definitely support Sweet Thang as a downtown addition, but will probably stick to their lunches. The search for the ultimate cupcake will have continue... although my sister did suggest that she back me in the business after this latest go round. : )",

    "text": "I stayed here for 2 nights during a trade show last week.  Although my boss booked a room with 2 beds, since my coworker and I were sharing a room, they assigned us to a room with 1 bed.  When we called the desk to complain they said we could come back to the front desk and they would reassign us.  They had put us at the very last room on the 6th floor in the pyramid, and it was a very long walk back to the front desk.  We discussed it for a minute and decided we could live with one bed, and proceeded to unpack and settle in.  Not 10 min. later SOMEONE ELSE ENTERED THE ROOM WITH A KEY CARD!  We were shocked!  They reassigned our room even though we had not returned to the front desk.  Just where did they think we were?  This couple was there for the same trade show.  It was awkward but we decided to pack up and move after the front desk agreed to send a bellman with a cart and our new room keys.  It took about 15 min. so we had to wait in the hall until he arrived.  We had hoped for a closer room, but no, now they put us at the next to the last room on the 9th floor.  Err.\n\nThe good news is our room was nice and it was so much better having our own beds.  However, we missed a short reception before dinner with all the moving and unpacking.  The room was fairly large with a room safe (I like these) and large 2-sink bathroom.  The shower was large but the shower head was terrible.  Think being hit in the face by a fire hose while showering.  Beds were quite comfortable.  \n\nI really don't care for this hotel.  The elevators travel on an angel to accommodate the slanted pyramid and they don't feel safe at all.  Stone cold sober you feel like you've had too much to drink, and you'd better be leaning against the wall or hanging on or you might lose your balance.  Walking to and from the room was a really long hike, and looking from the lobby up gave the impression that the higher floors were on an impossible angle.  I would not chose to stay there again, because it was just too unsettling.",

Yes, light, because since thanks to the warning of other yelpers I had appropriately lowered my expectations significantly, and can appreciate that I can get some steamed rice with lightly stir-fried or steamed veggies, and some meats that don't come with sauces, and platters of fresh fruits and berries in the morning.  You need a few light healthy meals while experimenting with all the amazing food options here, this isn't a bad place to make a pit stop.\n\nI should mention though that's also because we're staying here, and they've included 2 buffets for every night of our stay... else I may have a very different opinion at $29.99 a brunch.

The lady that rang us up forgot to tell us that the tip we signed on the bill was intended for our server.  Only then did we find out that the tip on the dotted line was meant for our server, embarrassing!  But we did leave a tip for our server in case you're wondering.\n\nOnto the food.\n\nFlat out, this place is overrated.  The photos you see on the net are glamourized.  Not as big as everyone says.  Options available for the most part are ordinary.  Quality is what you would expect of a buffet.  The dishes were lukewarm, bordering on almost cold.  Sushi is stale and dry.  Roast beef was average, but the chef that manned the carving station is a total sweetheart!  Shrimp and grits was, well, shrimp and grits.  The pulled pork sliders were better than I expected.  Didn't try the mini hotdogs.  Didn't try the cold fried chicken.  No king crab legs.  Didn't even go near the Asian section as the dishes looked stale, you know that dull-dry-sauce-look on foods?  Yep.  So what did I try?  The mushroom truffle soup, salty and creamy, it was alright if you like those flavors.  The clam chowder was alright, not as bad as I thought.  But nowhere near as good as the clam chowders from San Francisco (not a fair comparison as Vegas is in the desert and SF is by the bay).  I noticed that no one touched the salads on their plates, so I didn't go there either.  Boy, it sounds like I tried a lot of nothing!  But I actually tried 4 plates worth of food.  But nothing really stood out!  Oh yeah, the seafood paella looked great!  And it was actually just GOOD, not great.  You know what they had a lot of?  4 different pizzas; cheese, pepperoni, mushroom and deluxe style.  But who wants to eat pizza for this price!  And they had lots of sauces and salsa for the Mexican cuisine station...16 sauces and salsa! C'mon! Who is going to waste stomach space on salsa and chips!  However, you can the chefs to make you fresh tacos, which were ok.  If you like street tacos, you'll like these.  \n\nI read they have 20 different breads to choose from?  Only five to choose from and they were stale.\n\nA small island for desserts.  Now I admit, I don't have much of a sweet tooth, so the desserts were mediocre.  The chocolate lava cake was probably the best thing there, it was piping hot and oozing when I broke into it.  Nothing special about the gelato and I'm a huge gelato fan!  Only the lemon sorbet was palatable.  Tried the pistachio, raspberry, and mango also, meh.  \n\nSo is this buffet worth the high price tag? Not in my book.  But I'm glad I tried it, so I can say that it was alright.  The price should actually be $10 cheaper.  That's what I think this buffet is worth.",

Luckily we got there in time to snag the last table. This is not your typical restaurant as it is situated inside a wine store. Be very careful if you are planning to bring your kids here. This is not a kid friendly store. One of our friend's brought there kid here on another visit and broke something in store. The store owner forced them to pay for the item, so be warned! We started out with a cheese plate which came with grapes, jam, nuts etc and also bread. This was quite tasty! The main entree was quite expensive, I don't even remember the name of the fish but it was nice and flaky and fresh. Not quite up to the 28 dollar price quality that you would expect ordering the fish at McCormick seafood restaurant. I don't remember the final bill, but it was not cheap at all.\n\nPros: great fresh menu items, check the website for the most up to date items, great wine pairing, cheese plate is a huge plus\n\nCons: high price, very cramped seating, not child friendly\n\nHidden deals:\nCheck out the website for prices and specials\n\nHealth code rating: A.

They were cashing out, so I understand that everyone might have been busy...but a \"hello\" would have been nice. The men at the bar left, and I was 1 of 2 people sitting at the bar. And I waited some more. Anyway, after a little over ten minutes, I flagged a woman behind the bar to ask for a menu and was finally acknowledged. My glass of wine came out fairly quickly, but it took her a long time to ask if I was ready to order, even after I was clearly done with the menu.\n\nThe wait for the food wasn't terrible. When my wine was about 2/3 empty, the woman who took my order asked if I wanted another glass. When I asked her how much longer the food would take. She said it would be a while. So I ordered another. The food came out *maybe* 5 or 6 minutes later. I don't have a problem with waiting for my food if there's a reason. But please don't knowingly tell me \"it'll be a while\" just to sell me another glass of wine.\n\nAnyway, onto the most important part of the night: the food. I got sushi for my fiancé, which he ate & liked, but didn't rave about. I've had the pad thai from here before (which I've always enjoyed), and I wanted something new, so I tried the Roasted Duck Curry. Pretty fantastic. My only complaints are that the duck was *very* dry, I asked for brown rice and got white, and that the sauce to food ratio was severely lacking. If I order a curry, I obviously don't want soup (which this most certainly was not), but I'd like to have enough sauce that I can taste a bit in each bite. Generally, the lack of curry sauce made the whole dish feel dry and a bit boing. Still, the sauce itself was awesome and the vegetables were cooked perfectly.\n\nOverall, I'm on the fence. I've been a waitress for long enough that the lack of decent service can make me never want to return to a restaurant. Is a few tablespoons of great curry sauce worth a bad experience?

They were both really good and worth returning for. \n\nWe opted for a couple of appetizers - mostly because the rest of the menu felt a bit uninspiring given the price points. \n\nThe Frites were fine if perhaps under seasoned. They came with catsup and a pepper aioli. The aioli seemed over worked - it had more of a butter texture. It did have decent flavor - but lacked the expected mouth feel of an aioli. \n\nWe also ordered the Shrimp, Scallops, and Grits. This dish was worth recommending and ordering again. The shrimp were probably unnecessary - they were smallish and underwhelming compared to the perfectly cooked scallops and medley of roasted/sautéed veggies. \n\nWe took a look at the dessert menu and given a redo, I'd order something else. We ordered the bread pudding. It was more of two small pieces of French Toast. Decent flavor, but didn't pass muster for a Bread Pudding. It was served with a handful of walnuts and some sort of sorbet. The walnuts could have used some sort of culinary treatment. The sorbet had a descent flavor - perhaps ginger - but textually didn't work well with the mislabeled  bread pudding. I would have expected something with a creamy mouth feel. \n\nOliver's is still pretty new - it's listed as \"hot and new\" - but it seems a bit sterile and as others have noted it's noisy. The drinks take Oliver's from a two star to a three star place. It's nice to see another restaurant in this area of town. I think Oliver's still needs to find it groove if it wants to be a long term resident in the neighborhood.",

There were many stalls selling essential oils for aromatherapy, protein supplements, massagers. \nThere were some selling gourmet organic food stuff; coffee, olive oils, tapenades, jams, sauces, jellies, nuts, wonderfoods, honey, wax, tea etc.\n\nWe had a small Caeser cocktail sounded great (with potato vodka and walter's caeser mix; i love walter's caeser mix) which turned out to be terrible. There was a lot of black pepper mixed with a little salt kind of glued on the rim. It killed the drink as well as my taste buds for the rest of the day. We tried the Chicken paella which was uncooked. The vegetable samosas were okay but tiny and expensive for the price.\nWe loved the Riesling from Megalomaniac, it was very fresh and earthy; perfect for a summery afternoon.

    "text": "We stayed here for 3 days on a weekend business trip in mid March for the annual Aloha Festival at Tempe lake and were impressed by the remodeling efforts. The room was very comfortable and had a contemporary feel. It was equipped with a small fridge and microwave with a sink. Great place to stay for the road warrior. The day we were to check out, we decided to try their restaurant which offered a $10 breakfast buffet. It was a really expensive deal as the buffet was very basic. On top of that, one of the waitress has started putting things away as people were still trickling in. The kids' menu was very basic and I thought I'd just complement their breakfast by adding yoghurt and fruit from the buffet. As a parent, I wanted them to have a more balanced breakfast. No big deal, I'll eat less and they can have my share. It's a buffet! That's when one of the waitress snapped at me saying that she should charge me for the banana and the yoghurt since those items are only for adults who pay for the buffet. She went off for a good 5 minutes and I was just amazed at how she would worry about charging a customer for a 25 cent banana and a 50 cent yoghurt when the customer just spent more than $300 in her establishment. I was going to take her name down but suddenly, everyone went into hiding in the kitchen. So, I had to bring this to the manager's attention. I believe his name was B.J. He did a great job taking care of the issue. Zach, at the front desk was also great. So, thumbs up for the remodeling and customer service at the hotel. The restaurant, on the other hand, I would avoid completely. If you see a skinny waitress with sandy hair, in a pony tail, that looks like she's on drugs, expect 5 star customer service!",

The nice thing is that they have pictures of almost all their dishes plastered up on the wall if we wanted some visual idea of what we were to order and there's Chinese on their menu too. The owner also speaks both Cantonese and Mandarin. Unfortunately, when we went on a Friday night, the place was horribly understaffed with only one cook (most likely the owner) and one waiter. And since they serve on a table-by-table process, the food for us, a party of 8 took almost an hour to completely arrive. At least we had tea to keep our stomachs from growling too loudly.\n\nOnce the food arrived, I guess I expected more authentic Chinese cooking. The beef and chicken was steamed and looked like one of the healthy options you would choose off a separate menu. They had a nice variety of Chinese styled vegetables though and a very wide Asian drink selection. My regret is that I should have looked at some of the pictures before ordering because some of the dishes were surprisingly simple. Such as the shrimp & eggs for $10, which was literally a couple of shrimps put inside an egg omelet. I'm not quite sure how authentic that is...\n\nThe decor was simple. There were just a couple of tables for sit-down eating and only two tables that could accommodate large parties of either 6 or 8. It is also BYOB which I didn't discover until another party brought in a couple bottles of wine.

To make matters worse there was absoulutly nothing stocked or preped for her. She was litterly having to cut fruit for one drink at a time slowing her down even more.

Probably one that wasn't even in business, or maybe not even open, since there a no pumps.  But they are.  According to reviews, they've been open for at least a couple of years now.  Interesting.\n\nWhatever the case, they do seem to have a dedicated following - so you'll want to get there somewhat early.  We pulled in around 5pm and the place was a ghost town.  By 6 or so, it was almost full.  Consider yourself warned.\n\nService was good all around, from the start to the finish.  That's definitely their strong suit.  Unfortunately the food doesn't quite live up to the homey feel of the restaurant or the friendly service provided.\n\nWe started on the venison quesadilla.  It was actually really good.  Where venison can sometimes be gamey or even tough, here it worked, and the flavors were excellent.  My wife, who doesn't typically like venison - both for flavor and because it is eating Bambi - enjoyed it.  Though not enough to eat her entire portion, so I was able to finish hers.  Sweet.\n\nThen she had a salad wedge.  I've never been a huge fan of the wedge, because it means you get a head of lettuce and cut it into quarters (or some other section).  Come on - chop it up.  Wedges are a cop out.  But she seemed to enjoy it.\n\nFor dinner, she had a flounder sandwich and I had a blackened flounder plate with grit cake.  She enjoyed the sandwich.  My blackened flounder had next to no flavor.  The grit cake wasn't bad, but had a really strange consistency.  Instead of being a cake, it had a very thick outside and an almost runny inside.  Then there was a mixed mess of veggies on the plate, which was probably the best thing that I had.\n\nWe also had a blueberry cheesecake thing for dessert.  Not bad, but not overly impressive.  It's like a no-bake cheesecake in a graham cracker pie shell.  I'm sure their ingredients were fresher, but about anyone could do something similar in their kitchen in a short amount of time.\n\nThough I didn't have a sandwich, I'm thinking that's the strong suit here.\n\nOf note: They have custom-painted cornhole decks out front, with the initials \"EEK\" on them.  I'm wondering if they were done by Erin K. (who has the eek.yelp.com domain).

The only cinnamon rolls pops in my mind is Cinnabon or the ones get in roll in grocery store in a tube then lay them on cookie sheet pan to cook. I was excited check out the hype. \n\nThey have few different ones that can choose from all in a really awesome display all done up finish product. You also have the option that can make your own masterpiece. You just start the base with the cinnamon roll and the rest is whatever your heart desires. The smores really caught my eye. That the one I went with and my cousin went with made his own up. I forget what he came up with something with lemon flavor. Maybe. It was no way as artistic or had as much components then my smores. It was good. It had all the things associate with smores marshmallow, granola cracker, and chocolate. The only thing that was weird for me. The alcohol or if they do in the sauce on top was strong. I was thinking man getting drunk on cinnamon roll. The portion size is huge. Neither one of us were able to finish our cinnamon roll. I would almost say sharing is good idea if not super hungry. They also offer gluten free ones.\n\nIt small place not many seats. I am fan of the checkerboard old school dinner vibe get from the inside. You place order and then pick it up at the end of the counter. It open area so can watch your masterpiece come together. All the cinnamon rolls served in basket lines with checkerboard paper. The floor has that same look. Not sure if recall seeing fountain machine. They have refrigerator up front with lot of different options comes to bottle drinks from healthy ones coconut water, smart water, and more. They do have a widescreen in one corner of the restaurant.

I found the desserts to be slightly overpriced, but you are paying for the fun and novel atmosphere. \n\nWe ordered a Thai ice cream roll ($6.50) which was served in a bathtub like container. It was delicious. \n\nWe also ordered a Hong Kong waffle cone with matcha ice cream ($9.50). The waffle was fluffy and flavourful. It contrast nicely with the cold match ice cream and the fruit toppings. I would recommend it. \n\nOverall, I would recommend the Poop Cafe if you are in Koreatown. It is a fun and novel dessert house. A caution to the wise - poop themed cafes may not be for everyone.",

    "text": "Our hunt for decent Thai food in Markham continues...\n\nWe decided to stop here to trial their lunch menu this week because I was craving spicy sauce on rice that usually isn't satisfied until I get my curry fix. Their lunch menu runs from open until 3pm and most dishes are $9 or less before tax and tip. \n\nOff the lunch menu, I ordered the Thai red curry chicken and my companion ordered the Penang Char Kuay Teow. The Thai red curry chicken was decent, but definitely not the best I've had. The sauce was more watery than creamy, and the chicken was drier than I'd like. It did the job though, a decent saucy rice dish to satisfy my craving. The Penang Char Kuay Teow is a soy sauce based rice noodle dish that came with egg, shrimp and chillies. It wasn't as spicy as we'd hope, but it was tasty enough. \n\nWhile the food is mediocre, the service and atmosphere is pretty good. The service was quick, and the waitress' were pleasant. The ambience is nice, the restaurant is clean and the chairs are comfortable. \n\nNote: cash only and no outside drinks allowed.",

The dragon fire was an innovative dish I never seen before it was quite good and the marinade was tasty, but it's far from what you would expect in a roll, nevertheless it was a tasty, new experience. Now the California roll was at best average, the quality of ingredients can be better including the sashimi. As for the banana ice cream, nothing goes wrong with that on a hot day!!

You cannot move let alone dance because it is so packed.  The best way to go is if you get a table either around the dance floor or upstairs with a view of the strip.  That way you actually have a place to sit and room to dance.\n\nDrinks are also super pricey.  About $14 each and water is $8.

They were making a bunch of trays and large party take out orders instead of our order. By the time we waited, finished eating and were leaving, they weren't even picked up! There weren't very many customers at this point, only 3 other tables to be served.\n\nSinegang shrimp - it's standard, it's fine. I would be surprised if anyone can screw this up. \nDinuguan - this is probably the better I've had taste wise, but I'm used to tangy than a tiny bit sweet. I asked for vinegar and got soy/vinegar/sugar mix each time I asked for it which was really weird why they wouldn't give me straight vinegar at a Filipino joint. Their style of cooking is less tangy than I cook and a bit sweet. \nLechon Kawali - this was good lechon, nice melty fat but was deep fried so some bits were too crispy since it wasn't roasted. \nPompano on the grill - decent, the fish tasted fresh \nPancit - this was passable\nAmpalaya - It had eggs and ground meat and tomato. Pretty decent, but I can't eat a lot since I'm not a huge fan of ampalaya on it's own.  \nSisig - normally this is the favorite and what goes fast, but it was one of the items left because it wasn't that great. It was missing flavor. I added some of that soy/vinegar/sugar dip they kept giving me instead of vinegar to try to help it. \n\nI don't know why my family got halo halo and turon seeing as it took so long to eat, but the turon with ube ice cream was pretty nicely done.

Plates after eating and waiting for desserts werent cleared and we had to tell them we want to take home leftovers then were given ill suited boxes for them - too large and one thing was really soupy for a clamshell container. We had to ask for the check. We had to flag for items we need. The service just felt very pre- occupied with something that wasn't serving us. \n\nA plus is it's a sit down and seems to be made to order since the food was hot when received which this place had going for them.

Homemade Viet beef broth (you can taste the lemongrass and whatnots). The noodles had always been a nice chewy texture and the raw beef always fresh. Topped off with a stewed turnip (very yummy). They've always added the bean sprouts in the noodle since the beginning. So if you don't want any you'd have to let them know. \n\nI agree with some of my fellow Yelpers, that they've changed. \nThe soup now tastes more like the pre-made Costco broths.

That's the only reason why I agreed to stand in line with all the other curious discotequers; I pretended I was doing an ethnographic study. Really.\n\nWhy they had people stand in line was a mystery because once inside, there was no way to overlook the glaringly open spaces in what was purported to be standing room only. Just a smattering of Paris and Lindsey wannabes slouched around, getting all scripted-reality-drama lusty with the boys donning Ed Hardy shirts. Inside's actually pretty cool with the blue-lit bar and shiny surfaces. Drink prices are neither pretty nor cool--$10 for a well drink served in a rinky dink plastic cup. \n\nI had the good fortune of standing next to the long glass wall, from which I got the insider's view of the evening's pirate show.

Growing up in Texas, bfast tacos are a diet staple but outside those state lines you can only find breakfast burritos- which are totally NOT the same thing. At all. \n\nPlate here includes two massive tacos on double-layer corn, with options to add sausage, chorizo, or bacon to your eggs, cheese is included and condiments of sour cream and salsa are provided. You also get a potato side (reds or browns).\nHuge portion: tortillas were overflowing, removed over half the filling before I could even pick up the tacos to eat properly (not a complaint!), and the corn tortillas held up so well that I was able to stick to a single layer and used the extras to make additional tacos with the overflow!\nNot following? You can easily make 4 good sized tacos with this plate.\n\nChicken fajita omelet is a good pick too- potato side and bread side included (toast, english muffin, or biscuit). Servers have no problem with substitutions, and easily changed out my bell peppers for extra mushrooms. Sadly, the mushrooms seemed canned, but there as a more than generous portion of veggies in the dish. Hashbrowns were undercooked, but we didn't come close to finishing.\n\nNow for my gripe. You're the BISCUIT Café- not the breakfast taco café, not the omelet cafe. The biscuits here were lackluster and dismal, with little taste and an oddly crunchy exterior. Fluffy interior was great and the raspberry jam we received was off the charts, but when we ordered a side of gravy ... well, that was bad, too. Virtually tasteless and gluey, like a poorly made box mix. \n\nI didn't expect the breakfast tacos to knock it out of the park like they did (highly recommend the bacon and chorizo), but to fail at making your namesake dish?

I had a sangria to start and was so-so on it - I didn't hate it, but I doubt I would order it again.  My husband and I then split either a salad with tomatoes and burrata (not currently on the menu either), and despite the cheese overload, really loved that too.  For dinner I had the lobster gnocchi and thought it was really good.  We had wine with dinner and there was a good selection of bottles (I don't recall how the by-the-glass selection was).\n\nThe next time we came for dinner in January I was not super impressed.  We had the raclette to start (also not on the current menu), which was good, but way too much for just two of us.  While I debated going with the lobster gnocchi a second time (I wish I had...) I went with the scallops, which were prepared differently then.  They were SO salty I contemplated sending them back.  I didn't because I didn't want to be \"that\" person, so I guess I only have myself to blame.  Anyway, service was so-so that time, so overall it (literally and figuratively) left a bad taste in my mouth.\n\nFinally, a couple weeks ago I got lunch here to go - and this was strike two.  I ordered a pick two combo and got the caprese sandwich and kale salad.  The caprese sandwich really wasn't that bad, it was just strange... I swear it was served on Texas toast, which is just so odd.  Do they not have focaccia?  Or something else that doesn't look like a fifth grader's lunch?  Also, I swear they used canned tomatoes.  I get that tomatoes are not in season right now, but maybe that means this shouldn't be on the menu?  As for the salad - I do not eat meat so I asked for it without pancetta.  The bartender rang it in properly (it showed up \"no pancetta\" on the receipt), but I guess someone wasn't paying attention in the kitchen.  Sure enough, it had plenty of pancetta in it, which I didn't realize until I made it back to my office.  Luckily I work in the EY Tower, so I called down and asked them to remake it, which they graciously did.\n\nI will give this place one more shot, so at this point I wouldn't recommend NOT going here, but I also think there are better options in the Flats.",

This location has two TV monitors where I was able to sit, relax and enjoy the US open final between Serena Williams and Osaka. My only disappointment about this location was the portions served. I dined in and got half chow menu, half rice, orange chicken and mushroom chicken. The portions of the mushroom chicken and orange chicken were a bit skimpy. I literally finished eating those items in about 3 scoops. I don't mean to compare, but the Panda Express at downtown Summerlin gives generous portions. Not sure if they were being conservative because they were waiting for more of what I ordered to be cooked, or this is the new norm in terms of portions to be served for the side items. If this is so, then I will not eat at Panda as often as I have before. If it's just this location, then I will not be returning. Three stars for the friendly service, loss of two stars for portions.",

It's close and we love to browse around Bass Pro Shops. But we are hungry, it's lunch time. LIGHT BULB! There's a coupon in my 2011 Entertainment Book for Johnny Rockets in the Silverton. Perfect, it has been decided. \n\nThe restaurant is in the newly renovated/added area and it's pretty small. There is a counter with maybe 8 seats, a few booths that seat 4 comfortably, and about 10 tables (a variety of 2 and 4 seaters). The 10 tables kind of hang into the casino area, and there wasn't a clear place to go to notify someone you were waiting for a table. We just kind of hung around waiting for one to open up. Luckily that wait wasn't long. \n\nOur coupon was buy-one-get one, up to a $7 value so we kept that in mind while ordering. I had the combo with Fries and a Bacon Cheeseburger. Husband had The Original combo with Onion Rings instead of Fries. Each came out to $7. So with tax, tip and drink we came out of pocket $14. I think the prices are kind of high, but we are in a casino/hotel so that might be one reason why.\n\nThe food came out pretty quickly and the server was OK, not amazing, but OK. My burger was very good! Lots of flavor, loved the pickle relish, special sauced rocked and the burger was moist and juicy. The fries were just, eh. Kind of under cooked in my opinion. I like 'em crunchy! Husband enjoyed his burger too, but agreed that the onion rings were just, eh. My only other issue was that the burger might have been just a little too juicy. I know, right! But the bun was kind of soggy at the end :( So maybe the burger wasn't too juicy, but the bun was to WEAK! LOL. \n\nI'm sure we will come back. I have another coupon and I was very happy overall with the experience. Next time milkshakes are a MUST!",

Ramen is one of those food that you need to cook ahead of time like the broth and some of the toppings except for noodles.  After eating my ramen, I can understand why there was a big delay.  They had to cook new broth and noodles.  I can tell by watery taste of the broth.  The broth usually takes hours to cook and simmer so it can congeal.  The noodles were clumped and starchy.  This happens when someone is rushing to make the noodles.  The server did notice that we were disappointed and gave us 50% off on our meal.  Thanks to the waitress for doing that for us.

We had to be mindful that  we were ordering for a person who has not eaten much uncooked fish.  A couple of other challenges were, that the newb did not like salmon, and we do not like eel.\n\nWe ordered several large rolls and regular makis that had a variety of cooked and uncooked fish. We unfortunately did not order a ton of sashimi  due to the newbie factor.  The fish to rice ratio was not as high as I prefer.(like some places that are on the corner of Mayfield and Coventry)\n\nTip - when ordering sushi and the rice spirals around the fish, it may look cool, but that means you are eating a sh*t ton of sushi rice! \n\nManhattan roll had more avocado than tuna! WTF, if I wanted that much avocado I would have ordered chips and guac!  Well I might be embellishing a bit! However,  for 7 bucks more FCUK'n fish please.\n\nThe roll with softshell crab with  other things was off. I ate one piece and something tasted funny.  When rolls are made lots of different ingredients and sauces, its a bit more challenging to enjoy the simplicity of sushi. Anyhow, I approached my second piece and started to sample the contents of the roll and found something was bad, I asked my counterpart to taste the ingredient that I suspected was bad, and she agreed as well.  The manager promptly removed the item and offered to replace it with another Item of our choice.  The manager removed this item from our bill and handled this situation as professionally as possible.\n\nThe rest of the dinner went with out incident.  Our server was  incredibly attentive and  friendly. The water glasses never reached empty.  I was pleasantly surprised that there were some people whom had worked at Mallorca are now at the \"Rock\" \n\nSome of the other rolls which I can not remember the names of, but had things like shrimp tempura, spicy sauce,  mayo and some veggies, were quite tasty, our newbie, lets call him Joe, enjoyed the other large rolls as well.\nJoe who claimed to not like salmon enjoyed the Alaskan  (salmon and avocado) quite a bit.

There are many great hotel choices nearby and the location alone of the hotel for me is not enough, in fact, it's a drawback.  We could've stayed at a 1/2 dozen other hotels within the Old Montreal neighborhood, but chose this one becasue they are 'pet-friendly'.  This is true I guess in the sense that my dog was allowed to stay in our room, however, becasue of the location there is no grass within a reasonable distance.  And they put us on the 3rd floor.  The closest grass is in the promenade park on the river.  In the day-if the weather is good-going to the park with the dog is ok, but the day we got here it was pouring rain and a miserable experience at night to have to drag my dog all the way down the raucous street of bars and restaurants to pee in the mud.  Even when the weather is good, the park is not well-light and there are pleny of sketchy folks lurking about.  If you don't have a dog with you, than disregard this negative.  I understand not everyone cares about travelling with pets, but some do.  If you do, choose another hotel.  Also, it is a VERY loud section of the street.  DJ's blasts music every night and the bars on the streets close around 2 AM, even on a Monday.  If you're coming here to vacation and want to party late night and don't have a dog and don't want to sleep, then this hotel will be great for you.

But a few of my coworkers complained to me that she was rude to them.  She was never rude to me directly, but I could sense she was frustrated at times. \n\nI won't be dealing with them again.

I was expecting to be able to run in and grab what I needed quickly, but my visit turned into a big fiasco as soon as I pulled into the parking lot.  This place was packed!  I spent 5 minutes trying to avoid smashing into the other cars that were trying to make their way in or out of the lot.  Once I got in the building there were a ton of people standing in line which was a bit of a turn off.  The workers were very efficient and the line moved quickly, but it was still a little too busy for my taste.  I did like that they have quite a variety of bagels to choose from, and of course they have plenty of yummy-looking pastry treats to choose from as well.\n\nIf they're not so busy next time I come here there's a good chance I'll bump their rating up.",

They had a nice flavor to them and weren't greasy at all.  However, the Tomato Basil Pizza was not good....2 Stars at best.  The Tomatoes didn't have much flavor and tasted a little \"off\".....was not happy with that choice.\n\nTotal damage was around $8 and it included a bottle of Water.  Not bad for 3 Slices.  Next time, I order just Cheese slices.\n\nReturn Factor - 60%",

One thing about Golden Nugget's transformation over the years is their quest of becoming the toast of the downtown scene, something they've done rather quite well. Gold Digger's is an example of their image revamp from one of Vegas' most classic hotels to one of the premier hotel resorts in the area. It's a solid place to get the night kickin and a fairly non-pretentious venue just north of the strip.\n\nI once confused this place as an adult venue, expecting a different kind of dancing. But this is a happenin place on the weekend, though albeit a tad touristy, typically featuring an older crowd that are trying to get their dance on. They don't usually discriminate too often, hence the crowd is usually fairly diverse. The place is bigger than it looks and is reasonably clean, which is a plus for any club in Vegas.\n\nThe music is usually a DJ spun fiasco, composed of hip hop and top 40 hits. If people aren't drinking, they're usually dancing at Gold Diggers. Even though it's open late, their busiest times are usually toward the beginning of the night. The drinks pack their own punch due to a good pour from the bartenders, but feel spendy in this part of town.\n\nAnd usually the bartenders do a stand up job at keeping the crowd at bay from going over board. The staff is an attractive bunch of young folks trying to make it happen in the city of sin, without engaging in the annoying 'tude that is usually prevalent in LV nightlife. As for actual gold diggers, it seems they're out and about on the streets , than they are stirring trouble up in this joint.",

So we decided to go down to Garage because their happy hour goes until 7 on Saturdays (every day, I think.) The deals on drinks were unimpressive. The selection of beer on tap was an equal letdown (only 6 beers to choose from.) That was a bummer, for a place with \"Wine and Tap\" in the name. I am tap-happy though so maybe I'm just hard to please. \n\nWe shared an order of fries ($5) before ordering. The fries were crispy and fresh tasting, but definitely not so special in the way of flavor. We ordered a flat bread to share for dinner, which was tasty- but it wasn't really a legit dinner for two people. So we decided it'd be cheaper just to go across the street to Zipps and finish up our night there, with cheaper drinks to boot... \n\nWe'll probably go back because their patio is cool (as small as it is), and maybe next time we'll head across the other side of the street over to the Vig after. I don't see myself ever spending an entire night, or even just a dinner, at the Garage... but it might be a good starter bar.",

They were good size pan fried nicely with a dipping sauce.\nWe ordered family style and had the Singapore Noodles, Orange Chicken, Salt and Pepper Shrimp, Mongolian Beef and Half Duck. Would recommend the Singapore Noodles, which had shrimp, beef and chicken in a thin Noodle which was very tasty, Salt and Pepper Shrimp, which was probably the best dish as the Shrimp were medium size, shelled and a light crisp sauce applied mixed in a chopped array of vegetables of a stir fried blend. The Orange Chicken was also a nicely prepared dish with a generous serving.\n\nThe Mongolian Beef was flavorful but was okay and as for the Duck, once you have had the traditional roast duck, you don't want it prepared any other way and it came pan fried or something other than the traditional way and was more bone than meat.\n\nOverall it seemed as though this restaurant may better serve the Buffet style crowd during lunch time rather than the old traditional Chinese people looking for old style Cantonese food.\n\nI will say again, the Pot Stickers, Singapore Noodles and the Salt and Pepper Shrimp was something I would recommend you try.\n\nHonestly not my first choice for Traditional Chinese Food, but will keep them in mind.",

Not because I have any doubts about the establishment but more because quite selfishly I like having a coffee house to hang out and study in on Saturday nights and I don't want to have to give that up. They still serve coffee in the evening though and were very welcoming to the sit and study set. \n\nMy friend and I met one day after work to sample the new offerings and overall were pretty pleased. To start, the space is nice with more bar-type seating available. I really like all of the new art with the exception of one piece that to me seems like it should be in a cheesy Italian place, but that is beside the point. We just sampled two small plates but they were truly fabulous. My friend had the roasted beets. I generally do not like beets and usually force myself to eat them simply for the health benefits. These beets however were great. I would order and eat them and smile the whole time. I was shocked. I ordered a roasted stuffed poblano pepper that was perfectly cooked and had just the right amount of stuffing to sauce ratio. The sauce also had just enough kick without being too spicy. My only criticism of the food was portion size. For the price I would have expected 2 peppers instead of one. That being said I'm frugal these days and this place is trying to target a higher-end night life crowd. I spend my Saturday nights studying so clearly, that ain't me.\n\nI know a few more changes are in the works here as they polish the new concept but I think once people realize that they are now a wine bar too things will really take off.",

During our trip we were able to visit both and it took us only a 10-15 minutes walk.\n\nThe hotel has a very friendly and attentive valet parking staff. They make the service really easy because they give you a ticket and when you need your car, you can just call the front desk for them to pull your car out front of the hotel by the time you are ready to leave the hotel.  Unfortunately the cost of this service is $40, and thats not including the $5 tax that they charge on top of the $40. It is ridiculously expensive!\n\nOur neighbors during half of our trip were crazy loud. It was very frustrating. Unfortunately there is really nothing the hotel can do about it so we did not even bother to call to complain.\n\nThe maid staff here was very helpful and friendly. Our room was located directly across from the maid area so we were able to refill out stock of paper towels and toilet paper without having to get daily housekeeping.\n\nThe hotel also offered free breakfast everyday. We did not try any of the breakfast, but a lot of people were always in the lobby area to eat so I'm assuming it was good.\n\nThe hotel has wifi throughout the building, but it was very spotty in areas of our room. I could only sit in certain spots to get decent wifi coverage.\n\nThe complaints I have about this hotel is that #1--we saw a roach in our room--it hid in the microwave vents; #2--the staff working the front desk NEVER looked at us or greeted us in any way when we walked into the hotel. Other Residence Inns would welcome us with a smile or a hello--but not at this hotel. It made us feel unsafe as well since it appeared anyone could just walk into the hotel and have access to the rooms, especially since the elevators did not require key cards for usage.",

The app and drink specials are good.\n\nWe've been here a few times and feel so-so about it.  We were looking for a cheap HH close to home so we went to try some new things.  Upon walking in, we saw a couple sitting outside with a little wooden stand holding 6 samples.  We asked our waiter about it and it's their \"six pack\" which contains six samples pre-chosen by them for about $9.  We tried it and I liked more of them than my husband as he generally likes lighter beers and I tend to like amber ales.  I would order it again - it's fun to mix it up and try some new beers and ciders.  Plus, they give you a sheet with the name, origin, and brewery of each selection.  I asked for two samples of other beers and my husband asked for one.  We didn't really care enough for them to order a pint.  \n\nWe also had the egg rolls and jerk wings.  The egg rolls were good, but not great and the wings were a little disappointing.  You know what's even more disappointing?  Getting the bill and seeing a $1 charge for each sample that we asked for.  Seriously?  For a few sips to try them out before ordering a whole pint which would have been in the ballpark of $3?  Our server didn't even mention it when we ordered them.  It's really just the principle.  Not cool Yard House!

We do not drink much soda anymore but being a fan of this soda from back east I we had to get one to share. They do charge a .10 up charge to get instead of the fountain drink.\n\nStaff was very friendly. The girl at the register was great. She was pleasant and very helpful after we told her it was our first time here.\nThe place was clean and not busy at all. Of course just being after Christmas I am sure everyone was home eating left overs and it was New Years Eve everyone was getting ready to party! \n\nWell we both decided on the buffalo chicken sandwich with fries. We were told of a couple of other sides we decided to get the blueberry coleslaw as a extra just to try it.\n\nWe do not go to fast food that often so believe it or not have not have not tried the new soda machines with all the flavors in it. That alone is amazing! We did get the sweet tea which was pretty good, not real sweet.\n\nWe did try a couple of sauces on the side with the fries. The sweet sriracha one is good and blue cheese was ok, and got some buffalo sauce to dunk the sandwich in.\n\nSo the verdict ~\nThe fries were homemade ~ They give you a bunch, I suggest eating them fast because when they get cold they are not that good. \nThe sandwich ~ Not enough sauce on it, it was kinda dry, luckily we asked for some sauce on the side to use. The bread not sure what the roll is they used but it was a bit dry kinda stale tasting. We should have went up and said something but we don't usually complain and it was edible as long as you had your drink with it. \nThe chicken? Was good. Being a fan of Canes Chicken it is hard to compare. The chicken was tender and moist and had a good flavor to it.\nThe blueberry coleslaw. We both say skip! It is not that good. Kinda of a dry coleslaw. We both were not fans of it at all until I added a packet of mayo to it. Then it was not too bad. We would not get this again,\n\nWould we go back? Maybe to try at another time to get one of the chicken dinners not a sandwich or the coleslaw.\n\nIt was not a WOW factor for us. It was not disgusting and we would suggest everyone to try for yourself.  It is a nice place and clean that is a plus!\n \nJust eat your fries first!",

Dishes sat for long periods of time and service was just slow in general, despite it being a not-terribly-busy Friday night. The tip definitely reflected this lack in service. \n\nService aside, the food was very good. We had the Buffalo wings as a starter. They were delish! These wings are baked and they use some sort of buffalo type rub instead of the drippy sauce. The rub was flavorful and had a bit of a kick, but not overly so. The four of us shared the California pizza and the Meaty Meaty. The California was a neopolitan style of pizza and had mozzarella, blue cheese, tomatoes, applewood smoked bacon and spinach on top. it was awesome. The Meaty meaty had sausage, pepperoni, canadian bacon on the classic Picazzo's crust. The crust was very nice but the pizza itself was greasy and not overly memorable. All four of us agreed that the California was a homerun for sure. We also shared a chocolate chip cookie and a brownie skillet dessert. The desserts were tasty and just the right temperature. There are loads of choices of gourmet pizzas or you can build your own. The menu is loaded with pasta choices as well that range from organic to even having gluten free items as well. Very nice to have such choices!\n\nWe'll likely go back and try more items on the menu another time, but honestly, I don't know how long I'll be willing to put up with slow service.

I'm not saying it wasn't freaky having the feeling you were about to fall off the side of the Stratosphere, but in the third row (and most likely in all rows except for the front) you had so much in front of you that it's hard to see straight down to the ground.  \n\nIn the other rides, you are measurably separated from the Stratosphere - Big Shot throws you way up (so you can't see it) and Insanity dangles you a good distance off the side.  The further back you are in X-Scream, the more connected to the building you feel, which takes away from the \"I think i'm falling off now\" feeling.\n\nIt's worth the ride as part of the unlimited pass, no matter what row you get.  However, if you buy a single ticket for X-Scream only, you best be sitting in the front to get the most for your money.",

I prefer to take my own photos of my child and I think they usually turn out better than posed portrait crap. In all honesty, the only reason I came here was because I had a gift certificate. Oh, and also because my entire family thinks I'm a terrible mother for never getting lame portraits of my child. The horror! \n\nThat said, I had a decent experience here. The photographer was really nice and did a pretty good job with the tools she had available. Or maybe it really helped that my kid is very photogenic? She even said at one point that my kid was one of the cutest she had ever photographed. Maybe she was trying to sell me. Either way, I was happy with the photos. My favorite part was that they didn't use those horrific backdrops with trees and foliage and other ugly crap.\n\nAs for pricing, I am sure they are a bit more expensive than say JC Penney or Kmart. However, those other studios use one of those stationary cameras and Portrait Innovations does not. They are free to move around with a handheld camera. Use your judgment.",

The Edgewater fancies itself an upmarket boutique hotel but there are so many things that are just so wrong... interior design: my current room is painted in a color that presumably is intended to be gold but looks more like an olive brown. Quite awful and depressing. At first I was in a differently depressing suite facing the walls of another building. How is that even possible in a lake hotel? Then I was moved to the infamous lake front floor 1 - where do I even start? Not only is everyone walking by outside on the path right by your room, but on the way from the elevator to the rooms there are doors leading straight into the car parking. Nothing that says upmarket boutique hotel just like here's your room off of the parking garage... and Health and Safety? There is one metal door between the potentially hundreds (?) of cars and the guest rooms. I have no idea how that can be to code? I am just praying that there are at least carbon monoxide detectors, but what if they don't work? Just scary... Hygiene: there are robes in the rooms but the robes are hung in the toilet cubicles. Not the bathroom or the closet, but the actual toilet space! Because we all like nothing better than putting on a robe that is covered in the aerosols of the fecal matter of tens of customers before us? Request to Edgewater GM: Please make your teams wash all the robes and then hang them in the closets not in the toilet cubicles... And how come your head housekeeper did not notice and fix this already? And the non-existing customer service skills... I noticed two rats playing in front of my room (outside) and showed a photo to an alleged manager-on-duty and she proceeded to tell me that they were muskrats and I should be happy to see them as \"they are just like otters or dogs\". Seriously, that is a quote. You couldn't make this up.... Even if these were muskrats and they are not as bad as other rats (I don't know) there are ways of communicating this to a customer in a respectful way and telling them to be a happy about the Wisconsin \"otters\" is not really one of them. The reception staff seem to be college 'kids' on summer jobs, not actual trained hospitality staff. Finally, housekeeping must have accidentally taken my dainty little travel flower china mug from my room (after I left it on the dresser in the morning) somehow mistaking it for hotel dish ware. I eventually got it back, but not without multiple phone calls from my side. The lack of engagement and customer service skills in this hotel is really quite staggering.

The hostess later asked us how many and although it was extremely busy, we were seated right away, which was a plus. The place was just entirely too tight for my liking, both indoors and outdoors. There is one bathroom for men and one for women, but there was a line within minutes because the space is so cramped and small. The gazebo area is really mediocre at best. There is a draft that comes up through the bottom of the tent, so my feet and legs were freezing and my upper half was hot due to the overhead heaters. The chairs are cheap flimsy metal and are not comfortable in the least bit. The business could at least invest in some better outdoor furniture if they are seating you out in the gazebo area. So, now that I've got the ambiance down, or lack there of that is, now onto the food. I ordered the Mediterranean Chicken Sandwich ($10.95), which had a mixture of feta, tzatziki sauce, and olive relish. It was a little bland considering the flavors that drew me in to order it. I ordered a side of the coleslaw, which had vinaigrette and apples in it. Once again, nothing extraordinary. What I really did enjoy was the \"Engagement Grilled Cheese\" ($9.95). The tomato puree was really good to dip the grilled cheese in, and was a somewhat unique appetizer with a creative flare to the typical grilled cheese sandwich. Our server was great, he made up for the lack of service we received initially. Overall, I would try this place again at a less busy time of the year, but I'm not ecstatic to go back.",

I had checked online what the options were for a sit-down restaurant in the Las Vegas airport and noted this was close by to our departure gate.\n\nWe arrived with plenty of time to allow us to have a relaxed meal prior to departure.  We each ordered a pre-meal drink and reviewed the menu. It was varied enough that there should be something on there to satisfy most appetites.  Both my partner and I went for a steak.  I had an 8 ounce filet while my partner opted for the New York strip.  Both came with a salad and your choice of potato or rice. \n\nWhen our steaks arrived, I noted that we didn't have steak knives.  My partner quickly pointed out we were in an airport past security and they probably weren't allowed to give them.  But it wasn't an issue,  My filet was incredibly tender, perhaps the best steak I have had in the past year or so.  No steak knife needed. \n\nService was very efficient, friendly and attentive and we were done with plenty of time to spare.   It wasn't a cheap meal, but airport restaurants are never cheap.  But the quality was well worth the outlay in cash.  So if you're heading back to Alberta on WJ, arrive a bit early and enjoy a nice meal before the flight home.",

However, you don't go to Bampot to eat. You go there to enjoy one of their myriad of teas.\n\nTEAS: Bampot offers some of the best selection of teas in the GTA IMHO. My all-time favourite is the Desi Chai (Indian Masala Chai). It's creamy and flavourful. A pot for one person was enough for 3-4 cups. I was impressed. Whatever kind of tea you like, you will find it at Bampot.\n\nSERVICE: The service was courteous and friendly. Your waiter will be happy to advise you on the best tea according to your preferences.\n\nAMBIANCE: This place is not your typical cosmopolitan, hipster-ish tea house. It feels more hippy-ish, more relaxed, more communal, than commercial. It's a gathering spot for all kinds of people who come to Bampot to have a good time. Bampot is not for those seeking the next \"hot\" coffee / tea house in the neighbourhood. It's for those who want to enjoy a cup of good tea and have a relaxed conversation with their friend or partner.\n\nI know I'll be back at Bampot soon for another teapot of Desi Chai.",

The three floors of space mean that there's plenty of space to meet with friends or go for dinner with the family (kids are welcome until 9 pm as per AGLC regulations). While each floor has large bar area with plenty of taps for 'beers to come', each differs in style. \nThe first thing you notice when you walk in the main level front door is the super cool, mesmerizing overhead conveyor belt upon which empty growlers weave their way throughout the main floor seating area before disappearing to the basement level where all the cool kids go (because there's a hot bartender...I'm looking at you beardy man!). The main bar is situated along the far wall and the seating is comfortable and not too packed together. The street level patio area will be the perfect spot to sip beer while people watching.\nDownstairs, there's a large U shaped bar with seating and the surrounding tables. It's dark, it's a bit quieter, and it has peek a boo windows into the ladies toilets. Don't worry, you're not exposed...but you do have a view of the brewing tanks!\nThe very top floor is more of a 'dining area' with large yellow padded booths and a gorgeous bar-style seating area overlooking the avenue. It's the perfect place for people watching without having to inhale the smoke from ground floor level sidewalk smokers. \nI'm not going to comment on the menu, so far as to say it is quite extensive with the most expected gastropub dishes available (burgers, pizza, poutine). I am predicting that the house favourites will be the more meaty smoke house options like the 12 hour brisket and wonderful pulled pork. I like that Alberta grown/produced items are marked as 'AB' on the menu and that they already have two mealshare items.\nLast, but certainly not least, let's talk beer. There is currently no beer brewing at T5 but the owners, PJ Hereaux  L'Heureux, Ernie Tsu, and Wayne Leong were able to rent brewing space at Tool Shed Brewery in order to brew Trolley 5's very first beers; the Derailed Pale Ale, and First Crush IPA. They were also able to collaborate with Parallel 49 to create Cowboy Crusher (It's a Stampede thing) and local brewers Last Best Brewing to create the Downtown Dunkel Dunkelweizen. So far I've liked what I've seen and consumed at Trolley 5 and I can't wait to visit again.",

The Satay Chicken was perfectly grilled and was tender and juicy, and went great with peanut sauce,  I just love the peanut sauce, I could smoother everything in that! Oh soo good!\n\nThe Masaman curry I ordered medium heat and with chicken, and it was just what I had been craving.  The curry was sweet, creamy and spicy all the same time, the chicken and potatoes and carrots were tender, this was the perfect dish for a cold Sat night ( and for a Sunday brunch haha, gotta love leftovers). \n\nThank you Teresa for the suggestion I think I have found a new goto Thai place near me.",

The only reason I had to give it a 4 is because the food takes quite a long time which deters me from coming there as often. I'm okay with waiting for food but it's kind of a \"quick serve\" place where you order at a counter and they bring the food out. If it was more of a sit-down restaurant environment I wouldn't mind waiting but that's not their concept so it is kind of frustrating when food takes over 20/25 minutes.

Every room has its own story and style and really is total eye candy for anyone who is an antique & nostalgia lover like myself. \nIf you're a Murano glass enthusiast be sure to check out the stellar chandelier in the main living space to the left of the front entrance - it's a sight to be seen. This room also contains the mansions only remaining original fireplace mantle which is a work of art. Ask Ed about how it came to remain on the property, it's a funny little story. \nSpeaking of Ed, our host & owner of the mansion, was extremely knowledgable about the property and surrounding area. I of course had a million questions about both which he happily answered for me. \nUnfortunately we were only slated to stay at The Parador for one evening - I pushed for two but my thrifty husband won the battle. Oddly enough, even with only 24 hours and a football game to attend I found myself completely relaxed and feeling like I was at home within this beautiful house. \nOur (very clean - Bird of Paradise) room with its high ceilings and beautiful bay window facing the bustling Western Ave. was the sweetest little retreat from the chilly, wet, Pittsburgh weather. The antique love seat situated in front of our (electric) fireplace became my new favorite spot on earth for the few short hours we had to kill before departing. \nOur bathroom, with it's huge clawfoot tub was bigger than some of the rooms in our apartment and came equipped with delicious smelling soaps, shampoo, conditioner, and even makeup removing wipes - it's the little things, right ladies!?\nBreakfast is served several times in the morning, your choice. At 9am we were greeted downstairs by the smell of coffee and bacon - heaven. I was served the best French toast I'd ever had as well as delicious pumpkin bread, parfait with fresh fruit, and OJ - it was a great way to start a long day of travel.\nI am very happy to have had the chance to stay at this very special place that is The Parador Inn. We will be making a point of coming back next year. \n\nOther Notes: \n-There is free off-street parking in The Parador's lot, one car per room\n-Rooms have cable TV as well as mini-fridges \n-Inn is (very) short walking distance to Heinz field and local restaurants \n-Don't call the Parador too late in the evening, this is not a regular hotel that functions 24hrs a day - You will wake someone up and that can be awkward",

I really enjoyed the different sides as opposed to salsa or sour cream and the flavoured chips gave it a great kick.\n\nMexican Street Corn (2pcs) $9 - Mexican creama, queso anejo, arbol & ancho chili powder - I could have gone without this.

Definitely recommend it!\n\nIn Cod We Trust $4.95 - voltron sauce, lime creama, pickled red cabbage, green apple & cilantro - all the reviews are right - this is definitely a MUST TRY. The fish is very fresh and crispy\n\nPollo Frito $4.95 - peanut mole sauce, pickled green cabbage & salsa fresca - I didn't really enjoy this because I usually don't like chicken in my taco or peanut flavoured things.\n\nBeef Cheek $5.50 - ancho braised beef, lime avocado, green cabbage, pickled jalapeno & crispy shallots, queso anejo, charred pepper sauce - the beef was braised so well and it was so incredibly soft and juicy\n\nCarnita $4.95 - confit pork, jalapeno sauce, mango salso, queso anejo, chicharron, guacamole, cilantro - this was good but not something I would get again because it's not very well flavoured.\n\nTostada de Ceviche $6.50 - albacore tuna, gucamole, coconut milk, habanero, tomato, cucumber - I really liked their ceviche and it has a nice kick to it!\n\nWe also ordered two beers ($7 a pint) and a pitcher of margarita ($55) our bill came up to around $200 without tips (we ordered many duplicates of the above item).\n\nOur server was great, atmosphere was awesome.

The Grilled Octopus was perfectly charred and cooked just right, the watercress and purée enhanced the overall flavours. The Flat Iron Steak was equally as good but the only thing was the temperature of the food was not hot but merely warm and became cold a lot faster than expected. \n\nOx Tongue Yakitori, not sure what was so great about it.

If you want to make this a meal, they'll add fries to it for $2.50.\n\nI got the Crispy Chicken BBQ wrap and it came with your choice of chips, fries or sweet potato fries. Since the sweet potato fries didn't come with an upcharge, that's what I went with and oh man they were delicious. \n\nThe wrap was also delicious, especially because I had asked them to add a bit of Frank's hot sauce to the cut up crispy chicken, bacon, lettuce, tomato and onions.\n\nEven though this was a busy night, the server got all of our orders right and refilled waters timely.",

And boooommm, the shrimp & fish grabbed my attention along with the beef & lamb meatballs. I'm always a sucker for beef and lamb mix. So it took about ten minutes to make which was perfectly fine as it seems everything was made fresh to order. Always a plus point. The minor bump was from the lady who was wrapping the sandwiches (same person who made the drink) I asked her to cut the meatballs wich in half and it seemed the request irked her a bit as as I got an angry facial expression....no smile and quick cut and there you go. She did ask if I wanted the fish/shrimp cakes to be cut but I passed fearing the backlash....oh I also added a peach/star anise seltzer which was a cool unique taste for a hot summer day. All in all, would pass by again to see what's on the menu next time I'm in town. The sandwiches were great and a good balance, unique taste. I would advise the staff to beef up the seafood cakes next time....",

There were 8 of us. \n\nI was lucky to have had the opportunity to be invited by the Hyatt Regency on King St (formally the Holiday Inn) to organize a bloggers lunch and to sample BOTH the lunch and dinner Winterlicious menu. There was soo much food. \n\nThe hotel is in a sweet spot, right in the middle of the entertainment district. Inside the restaurant, the decor was modern and simple. We were seated in a private room with skylights, providing lots of beautiful sunshine and brightness to the room.\n\nSome of the highlights at lunch included a lobster poutine and a savoury lentil soup. The lobster meat really shined in the poutine since there was not a lot of gravy to overpower the dish.\n\nThe dinner items were my favourite. I loved the sable fish since the cod was moist and meaty.  My last recommendation would be the 6 hour braised lamb shank since it was \"fall off the bone\" goodness and the plating was simple, yet beautiful.  The dessert was good but did not really stand out for me, compared to their mains.\n\nThe portions were generous, the food was delicious, and at a price of $20 for lunch and $35 for dinner, that is an amazing deal for the quality of food.\n\nHaving met Chef Wesley and the kitchen staff, I can tell you the food is cooked with love and passion.",

I would have to guess that they have a hard time when faced with large parties but everything came out at roughly the same time and my food was hot when it arrived.\n\nMy favorite bite of the night actually came from the Yelper seated across the table from me.  She ordered the mantoo and graciously traded bites with me for some of my kabli pulao.  The mantoo consists of bite and a half sized ground beef and onion dumplings with a meat sauce and a yogurt sauce on top.  I really, really liked the combination of flavors and the presentation was simple yet beautiful.  I would have gladly eaten an entire order!\n\nMy entree was a ground beef kebab that was over a foot long and beautifully seared with a really pronounced charcoal flavor.  It came on a bed of Afghani rice which included raisins and carrots.  Savory and well seasoned, it completed the dish.  That said, the beef was a little dry and benefited from the occasional dunking in the yogurt sauce.\n\nI also had a beef samosa that was a steal for a buck.  It came with a sauce that included jalapenos so I had to leave that part of the dish alone.  The others at the table who sampled it had great things to say, including the description of it tasting green.  Plenty of green ingredients and it looked like something I would have enjoyed if it didn't include the one green ingredient I cannot eat.  The samosa itself was just about perfect.  I really liked the addition of several different peppers in the meat mixture both for the flavors they added and the color.  They were fried perfectly and were the right balance between tender and crunchy.\n\nBaklava for dessert, iced tea to drink plus a generous tip and I was still out the door for less than $20.  Thanks again Phoenix for having me at your ISC.  It was a pleasure to meet everyone and I enjoyed the restaurant!",

The Falafel sandwich is probably my favourite in the city, and oh yeah, it's HUGE. It's not often you get quality and quantity like this. You'll pay a few bucks more here than at a Middle Eastern chain but believe me it's well worth it. I usually have half a sandwich and save the other half for later. They use this awesome pita bread for both the Shawarma and Falafel (that they get sent in from Montreal I believe) and when they press your sandwich, it takes on an almost crispy crepe-like texture. Awesome. This place is doing it right. I will say that a few of the sides that they offer are lacking in flavour, and I usually hold the pickles and onions on my sandwiches as they have a tendency to over-power.This is a killer joint!",

They serve a brunch menu at 14.50$ per person, offering you starters to share; a cherry tomatoe and cucumber salad topped with creamy ricotta cheese, some nuts, homemade jam and chocolate hazelnut spread and a Turkish spread that resembles butter (I can't remember the name) which was so delicious. You complement it with a dish of your choice. We had the French toast with chocolate and tahini and the lamb meatballs. Both dishes were tasty and the presentation is great! Staff is very friendly, explaining everything and making suggestions. I would definitely go back, maybe for supper next time!",

    "text": "I normally don't feel comfortable writing a review about a restaurant after one meal but i feel compelled to write about my experience at Mango Shiva because, for the most part, it was pretty great.\n\nI have seen this restaurant's name appear on Yelp a number of times, i bookmarked it as a place to try not knowing what to expect, and on a whim decided this to be the venue for a very special occasion. After hearing claims of how Mango Shiva offered South Asian comfort foods with a fusion, upscale twist, I thought it might be a welcome change for two individuals who are accustomed to classic South Asian hole-in-the-wall take out joints. That being said, nothing i read or heard prepared me for my experience at Mango Shiva.\n\nThe first point of contact for me and Mango Shiva was Yelp and their OpenTable integration for reserving a table. This service immediately earns kudos as any initiative to make the dining experience more accessible and easier for customers through the incorporation of technology and media is a huge plus (and in the world of South Asian fine-dining--simply an unheard of practice). So, +1 for that.\n\nNext, our arrival at the restaurant. We arrived a few minutes before our reservation on a Monday night at 6:00 and the restaurant was dead so we were seated immediately. The interior is quite elegant: chandeliers, hardwood, and touches of darker tones everywhere. The ambiance inside is remarkably intimate for an open but small space which makes it even more appealing to couples looking for a special spot to dine. Promptly after being seated the waiter arrived, a really nice young man who, though he might have been new, tried best to describe and sell the menu to us new guests. I am definitely no expert when it comes to South Asian cuisine but i am lucky to be the partner of someone who is. Fortunately for me, she navigated the menu very easily; saving the waiter from looking any more confused than he actually was (i will cut him some slack though, i don't think he got over the shock of a brown person, myself, asking him, a caucasian man, to describe certain South Asian staples that almost all  brown people grow up eating..except for myself of course lol). We ordered the Fish Pakoras, Eggplant Curry, and the Spicy Thai rice and wow, what flavour! The naan, soft, moist, and delicious. The Eggplant Curry, sumptuous. The Thai-Infused Shrimp and Rice, just excellent; a great pairing of savoury and subtle sweetness. The chef and kitchen staff have a clear standard for excellence and all the spices and flavours were off the charts. I have been eating brown food my entire life and their unique compositions of South Asian foods definitely made for a dining experience to remember!\n\nThe only unfortunate thing about the entire meal were the portion sizes. I guess in adapting modern, Western forms, the one aspect of South Asian cuisine that was lost in the fusion were the portions. Everything being designed to be single-serve or satiable for one person can leave a South Asian like myself a feeling a little disappointed upon the arrival of the bill and that unsavoury aftertaste can be enough to deter the typical brown gourmand from returning (although that crowd wouldn't even make the trip downtown to satisfy their appetite in the first place). With that being said, the service was great and the meal was excellent. I can still taste the flavours and am already looking forward to my next trip.\n\nIf you are looking for a location that is bound to culminate in a great meal with unexpected conversations, be it from the decor, ambiance, or the exotic, inspired South Asian food itself, Mango Shiva should be on your list of places to dine in Calgary.",

Our server was pleasant, the food came out within twenty minutes, and we ate it in far less.  \n\nN.B.Sides and specifications, all are a la carte, making for part of the pricey bill, but our server was kind enough to point out sides are large portions and can be shared\n\nBottom line- I would go back.

Only reason I didn't give five stars is carpet in room was in poor condition and we had to have room keys remade at least six times in two days.

This is a different location than this coming Friday and Saturday Festival.\n\nThe mission was to pick Strawberries and decide later if we stick around to see the film. The film area was outdoors in the field and not in a barn?Guess that what it meant by Field Trial Barn which was really spacious for lots of attendees. It was just too hot to be out in the sun to watch the flick, so we left after picking the strawberries.\n\nParking for $5 and was conveniently located to walking distance to Strawberry fields. There was play area for kids and rides. Noticed Coke booth but did not see a lot of other eateries nor food trucks for we were by the strawberry picking area and entrance.\n\nPicking strawberries is fun and what a work out. Just bend and search for your own strawberries. Wonder how many calories I burned in  30- 40 minutes. Not messy at all or did we get any bug bites from picking all these beautiful strawberries. Searched carefully for ripe strawberries and did not throw any on the ground. What we picked is what we tooked being mindful of mother nature. \n\nMake sure you wear comfortable closed toe shoes or sneakers. Some patch area were muddy too. There were discarded strawberries on the ground and you walking on clay soil pathway that was not leveled. Had to grab friend standing next to me cause I lost my balance.\n\nI definitely will be back next year and the year after just to pick strawberries. Tasting fresh picked strawberries is not the same as buying them from the grocery store. It's all about the experience. We had a great time. \n\nStaff was helpful and attentive to attendees. Caution driving into parking area and watch out for kids and pedestrians. Staff will guide you through.",

    "text": "Once you reach the building that Umami resides in, going up the stairs to the top floor is like an experience. With each flight of stairs that you climb, the wallpaper pattern changes and each design is beautiful. The staircase is a bit narrow and the steps are rather steep but it takes less than 5 minutes to reach the 3 flights of stairs. Once you emerge, the set up is small and cozy with a bar on your left and the kitchen along the length of the restaurant. I really liked the aesthetics of the restaurant and it even translates to the presentation of the food. \n\nFood and Drink Ordered:\n* worth trying\n\n- [Suppai Shoga] : Beautifully presented. Tasted very refreshing and has a strong ginger taste which could be a hit or miss for some people. The foam on top had a lemony taste but I missed some of the other flavors in the drink. \n\n- [Karaage] : Tastes like the description: fried chicken. The meat was not dry, which was a plus but I've definitely had better. I actually preferred dipping it in the takoyaki sauce rather than the sauce that it was provided with. \n\n- [Takoyaki*] : Tasted like good classic takoyaki.\n\n- [Robatayaki] : Because we couldn't decide on which robatayaki to order, my friends and I ordered one skewer of the bacon quail egg, chicken heart, and Wagyu beef tenderloin. This appetizer was a bit disappointing because there wasn't any flavor for the chicken heart and Wagyu beef tenderloin. The Wagyu beef was also a bit tough. The bacon quail egg was delicious but it's usually pretty difficult to have a flavorless bacon quail egg. \n\n- [Chirashi bowl*] : Overall, the taste was good. My friend said that this chirashi bowl was better than the one at Chaya Japanese Cuisine. Some of the fish tasted very fresh but others did not. Not to say that the fish tasted bad but it wasn't phenomenal. I did like the addition of the pipette; it controlled the amount of soy sauce necessary for the fish so that the flavors of the fish weren't smothered. \n\n- [Tonkotsu Ramen*] : The ramen was very delicious, especially the broth which had a very strong sesame taste if you're into that. The only downside is that the pork ribs were a bit dry.\n\nWould I go back? : Of course! I believe that food should look as good as it tastes and for the most part, Umami hits that mark. I like all the options that Umami provides. Even after ordering five items, excluding the drink, there are so many other items that I wanted to try. This place is really nice to good with friends so that you can try a little bit of everything for a reasonable cost. The only reason I did not give a 5 star rating was because not everything that I ate hit the mark but if I could on Yelp, I would give Umami a 4.5 rating because it was pretty darn good.",

So on to my review! \n\nMy boyfriend and I have been spoiled by delicious ramen in Edmonton at Prairie Noodle so I was intrigued to try this new ramen place that opened up by my work in Calgary. Gagana is an authentic Japanese ramen place and definitely not fusion. Their menu is nice, small, and uncomplicated. (the way It should be.) They gave us a free chicken karage appetizer and it was AMAZING, I would go back there just to have that. We also had the pork gyoza and they were REALLY good. I am pretty judgemental of pork dumplings and these ones were fantastic and not greasy like they can be. \n\nMy boyfriend ordered the spicy miso ramen, and his first comment was \"for someone who REALLY loves miso, this would be amazing\"  so the miso is miso-y folks lol. But in all seriousness it was pretty good according to him, I didn't try it. \n\nI ordered the tonkontsu ramen. The bamboo, pork and the noodles themselves were fantastic. The noodles had a really nice \"chew\" to them. But, like I said above, the broth was just WAY too fishy for me. I might order the dipping ramen next time to avoid the fishy broth and then I think I'll like it a bit better, or I might try one of their rice dishes! \n\nI would definitely love to go back and try some other things.

As soon as I saw the menu here, I started (favorably) comparing it to Miller's on Polk Street in SF, where I first had matzo ball soup.\n\nThe soup here, which we started with, is just as legit. And the portions are just as huge, too- the one pictured is a cup. It could easily be a lunch, and is served with a couple of tasty-ass bagel chips too. Rye flavor, natch.\n\nBF opted for one of the most expensive (and largest) sandwiches ever, the JR Boucher, which is a triple-layer with pastrami and liver. Yeah, that didn't sound tasty to me at all, and it's $18. But we got it, and it's frickin' delicious: all the components work so well together, they harmonize like a choir of angels. Oh and one sandwich is easily like three meals. We shared it and still had half for dinner.\n\nAnd, because I'm a total glutton and never on this side of town, I had to get my own dish, too. I got the Ceily's stack- latkes stuffed with brisket, topped with two types of cheese and brown gravy. It's even more amazing than it sounds, priced at $12, and is also easily split into thirds. Just finished my order for lunch today.\n\nWith two heavy take-out boxes in hand, we rolled ourselves out the door... And promptly axed any plans of looking for a rental property in Henderson, because I don't want to weigh 400 pounds and if this place were nearby, that might be a serious possibility.",

Unlike some of the other bars in the area, they are open until 2:00 a.m. and their kitchen is open until last call.\n\nThe beer selection is your typical sports bar stuff from the big brewing companies like Moosehead, Molsons, etc.  - which is fine - as other bars in area cater to the craft beer crowd. \n\nThe place has a great back patio that is open until 2:00 am, and has a couple of large HDTV screens with proper HD signals feeding them. \n\nWhen the patio isn't open, the place is still large and is good for groups. Lots of TVs for viewing sports on as well, with good sight lines. Though some of the large TVs inside do not have proper HD signals feeding them, it still seems to be getting good clean digital standard definition signals though.\n\nI found the service to be attentive and the wing specials on Monday and Wednesday are good. I find the food at this location is very good for what it is essentially: American diner food.\n\nThis place accepts credit, debit and cash. So I give it a four out of five because I've had only good experiences here. Definitely recommend it for late night eating and for watching sporting events.",

    "text": "I first started taking my animals to Alta Vista back in 2006 when we moved to Central Phx.  I was impressed by their website and all the services they offer.  Very pleased with the level of care my animals received and, although the exam fee is $45, I always felt like the staff, techs, and vets were truly concerned with the health of my pets and not just looking to tack on additional costs.\n\nThey have extremely accomodating hours and will even make house calls!\n\nI started taking my Shi Tzu-Poodle to the Pup Scouts Doggy Day Care about once a week as well in hopes of getting him better socialized to other dogs (he's more of a cat-dog).  I loved that they were also so excited to see him and even let him hang out under the check-in counter when he didn't want to play with the other little kids (the smaller dogs or those that are old and slow are kept in a separate area from the larger, high-energy campers).  I boarded him there a couple of times as well and felt so much better about leaving him there than at the previous \"Pet Hotel\" I had used.\n\nWe just moved back to the area and am relieved to have them close by again. \n\nI was truly won over by Alta Vista again last week when we brought our newest furry addition in for a check up.  We had found an 8 week old kitten hollering after being put outside in the 113 degree heat.  I've never seen a cat drink so much water in one sitting!  There are of course a lot of \"start-up\" costs involved in giving a new animal a home.  As I was getting ready to check out the gal at the front desk pointed out that I'd qualify for a Kitten Package that would only cost $200 total (all of which I did not have to pay at that time) and save me literally $300 when all was said and done.\n\nA week later I was in at 8pm on a Friday night with one of our other cats.  I will leave out the details of kitty's diagnosis, but the outlook was not good and completely unexpected.  The vet took the time to explain the situation to me and then again to my fiancee.  The tech referred to us as \"Mom and Dad\" while we were waiting for the outcome of the surgery, which made me feel that they understood how important our little guy was to us.  The gal behind the counter even put on a DVD for our daughters and gave them crayons and coloring books.  Even the guy who was mopping the floor pointed out where we could find the restrooms and water-cooler if we needed them.\n\nIn the end, we had to make the toughest decision I have ever had to make and had to put kitty to sleep.  The care and concern of all those at Alta Vista that night meant so so much to me and my family.  I left knowing that my cat had received the best possible care and fully trusting that the health and life of my cat was their paramount concern, even at 10pm on a Friday night.\n\nNot that I look forward to taking our pets to the vet, but knowing that I can trust the people and place I take them gives me a lot of relief.",

It took a few minutes to settle in to the noisy atmosphere, but a pitcher of margarita helped take the edge off and ease into the surroundings.\nWe were taken off guard when asked to move from our table because it was about to get busy and our 4 top table would be a valuable commodity, but that is an afterthought once we adjusted to our new 2 top and the food came out. That's when it all came together. It's must have been the moment when the first bites were taken and the margarita had reached its apex in our bloodstream, cause that's when it became clear. Johnny mango is just plain good food the way god intended it to be, fresh, natural, cooked to perfection with no artificial ingredients or accoutrements to smother it all with. \nYes, that's when we realized how this meal had transported us to our visits with other countries where they cook in the same vein, and it's just damn good natural organic regional food. That is what happened in johnny mango that afternoon. We felt we were eating a quality wholesome meal in Costa Rica or a remote island someplace. \nThen we took in the local patrons and could see evidence of world travelers among us, like us. Some  of the younger ones go all out with their earrings, plugs, bracelets and cultural shirts and dreads, but we could read the older ones too, like us, had flair of our own travels abroad worn proudly as well.

Being that we were there to celebrate my husband's birthday, I figured it was the perfect excuse to buy the birthday cake truffles. \n\nYou can purchase them either in store (3 truffles to a pack) or online. Make sure that you have somewhere cold to store them if you aren't planning to eat them right away though as they require refrigeration. \n\nBecause I bought them the day before as a surprise, I also got myself cereal milk soft serve to enjoy then and there with a corn flake crunch topping. It was not at all what I was expecting. Their soft serve is sweet, but not in the way vanilla ice cream is. It's more subtle and was almost tart alongside the crunchy cereal. The combination was so addictive, I couldn't put it down long enough to snap a picture.\n\nAnd those truffles? Worth every freaking penny. Here is a description taken from their webpage; 'vanilla rainbow cake mixed with vanilla infused milk, coated with white chocolate and rolled in rainbow cake crumbs'. Yes to all those things please! \n\nUnfortunately the lady working the night I went was annoyed with the world and practically rolled her eyes while taking my order. Nevertheless, the guy who actually gave me the items was very nice. It's more than I'm used to spending for dessert, but when in Vegas I suppose.  \n\nTheir cookies also looked ridiculously good, and I saw lots of people ordering the 'crack pie'.

No crazy variations or additions here...  Water, Malt, Hops, and Yeast.  Done.  For those looking for more adventurous craft offerings, you'll likely disappointed.  However, if you have a true appreciation for German offerings, Hofbra is a great asset to the city in that regard.\n\nThe food overall is decent.

Free from any remains of food or gunk stuck like how other Asian/pho places in Chinatown.\n\nBoyfriend and I always order the spring rolls to start off with. I order the Pho Tai (rare beef steak) and he orders the Well Done Flank. Each bowl was about $7.95. Pretty good sized portion too. Our orders always come super quick....like within 3 minutes!!! Even quicker during early dinner time. Wow! I'm loving that!\n The one thing that stands out with Pho Annie versus other pho places I've tried is their broth contains no MSG. It's not as salty. Broth is still fantastic and drenching it in Sirracha sauce is even better!!!!! Yumm!!! This is PERFECT on a cold, winters day!!\n\nWe met the owner too, Annie. Such a sweet lady. Very friendly and personable. Even though it was super busy that day, she still stopped by and had a chat with us.",

The menu might look giant, but all the dishes are just slight variations of each other.  If you had broken rice with about 11 different things you can get on it... just imagine the different variations of menu items you can write.  \n\nMy dad had the bi suon ta hu ky which is shredded pork, pork chop, and a tofu skin wrap filled with shrimp.  He really liked it and said it reminded him of something that he would get in northern cali.\n\nMy mom and I ordered dishes that are really hard to find at other restaurants.  She had these little rice vermicelli pattie noodles with some pork and a fish sauce topping.  She said the vermicelli was a little dry, but the pork was really good.\n\nI had the banh canh which is an udon like noodle in a  a light pork broth.  The broth was really good.  I think it's better than the one next door (unphogettable).  If you look at the broth, it's crystal clear which is something that's hard to do.  \n\nPricing is really fair with around 7.99 a dish that would have anyone walking away really full.\n\nI give it only 4 stars, because the tea situation really weirds me out.  They pour tea in a tall glass that would be used for water.  The glass was really hot, and it cooled down really quickly.  My mom even asked if they had a pot of tea, and they said no.  She said a pot of tea would stay warm longer and taste a lot better.\n\nOverall I would definitely come here and eat anytime while I'm grocery shopping.

I feel like customers could just skip the payment lol, but I guess they believe the honor code here in Vegas.\n\nNow the foood! I got the cabeza and al pastor taco which were both great and flavorful. The cabeza was awesome and just melted in your mouth. I also got the lengua fries, which was only tasty on the top.

It was relatively close to the hotel and not in a seedy or shady area. The shopping center it was in was a little seedy but the area wasn't too scary. I went w my 3yr old so if it looked creepy on the outside I wouldn't have gotten out of my car. I was very impressed with the customer service that this place offers. They always have an attendant on duty and they are always available. As soon as I walked in I was greeted and helped out. The staff seems very honest and friendly. The gentleman there personally walked me over to the machine and showed me how to use the machine. Later a woman helped me with the dryer. I can only speak to the do it yourself service and experience. They offer a service if you want to drop off your clothes and have them wash, dry and fold them but I didn't do it that way. I would recommend bringing your own washing detergent and fabric softener. They do have a vending machine that sells the detergent but its quite expensive ($1.75 for a small one load box). They also sell fabric sheets (4 for $1).  The machines are operated only by coins (quarters) and they do have two change machines that take denominations up to $20.  There are small, medium and large washers. I used one small one and it was $2.75 and I used one large washer and it was $4.75.  I am not sure about the larger machine cost to wash.  There were a lot of machines to wash with no wait. There were a ton of dryers with no wait and i only saw two dryers. One for regular clothes and another set of bigger ones for comforters.  The dryers cost .25 for each 7min, the girl recommended paying $1 to insure that everything dries.  The only reason I didn't give a 5 star was the girl there told me to stop taking pictures. Otherwise it was a 5star experience. I forgot to mention that the kind man at the beginning turned cartoons on for my son. The free wifi is awesome and I saw the coffee and massage chairs but didn't use them. Hope this is helpful!!",

    "text": "Ok, just back from my second visit. After my first visit and review, I received/exchanged a few emails with the manager. It appears that she/they are very open to feedback and interested in improving. Kudos for that. I was offered a few meal on my next visit, which I declined. I wasn't looking for freebies, instead wanted to help this place improve and prosper. \n\nGuess what ! ? ! ? On this visit, almost all of my prior critiques had been addressed/fixed. My server this time was Britt (no cutesy fake names). She immediately asked if it was my first visit at Snooze and this location in particular. I asked if the Corned Beef Hash was available in a half order. She seemed a little stumped, but instead of a direct yes/no answer, she asked if I wanted one egg or two and if I wanted toast. (I asked for one egg and no toast). I also ordered a half order of the carrot cake pancakes. \n\nAfter a very short wait, my food came out. It was a large portion of hash, with one soft poached egg (exactly as ordered). So many places seem to have trouble getting soft poached eggs, but here it was perfect. Firm white, and completely soft, runny yolk.  All nice and hot. The corned beef hash was some of the best I have ever had. Nicely shredded potatoes mixed with pulled corned beef. Obviously fresh-made and not some prefab, out of the package stuff.. The carrot cake pancake was delish as well. It was like eating that piece of carrot cake for breakfast...I almost convinced myself it was a daily helping of vegetables. And best of all, the food all came out hot...\n\nI got to the restaurant just before 9am. As I was seated, I noticed two female managers just finishing up what appeared to be a manager meeting over breakfast. They were just finishing up, and got up shortly after I was seated. I did not see either one of them again until just as I was finishing up. At that point, one of the managers delivered a pancake flight to the table next to me. Other than that, no \"table visits\" were witnessed, even though the restaurant was full. The good news is that If a table visit had been made, the only  critique offered would have been \"Good job, things are great\"..\n\nAs I was eating, my server did a couple of \"check backs\" and offered soda refills (I don't do coffee).  When she brought the check, I noticed that instead of a \"half order charge\" for the hash, I was charged for a side of hash and a side of one egg. Not  a big deal, but IMHO, the server should have stated up front that while it wasn't available as a \"halfsie\", it could be ordered as sides..I am not sure if my side of hash was the same portion as a full order or if it was less/ more. \n\nQuick credit card processing by Britt completed the dining experience. On my way out, the cashier/hostess genuinely thanked me for my visit. \n\nAfter two visits, Snooze has now moved up to one of my favorite breakfast places.",

She works inside a large building which requires passing through security and they haven't had an issue getting the flowers to her desk. \n\nThe only snafu we've had was that this year the flowers were delivered a week early. I double checked my confirmation to see if I made a mistake, but sure enough I selected the correct date. My mom even said that her card had the correct date, but there the flowers were one week early. Mistakes happen so it isn't a huge issue. Overall, I am happy since the flowers are always beautiful and delivery has been perfect most years.\n\nA major perk to ordering from Sisson's versus using a middle man like 1-800- Flowers is that the end product arrives as pictured. The flowers that have been delivered to my mom have always looked the same as the arrangement I selected online. Sisson's flower pricing is reasonable and the delivery fee is reasonable as well. Each year I order an average sized arrangement with delivery for $75-$100. \n\nI'm thankful for this local shop.

They also have a great offering of mimosas, and will mix the juice for you (cranberry pineapple for the win!)\n\nThe egg white dish is really unique because they use a whipped cauliflower puree on top that resembles a béchamel, without the guilt. Brilliant!!\n\nThe only negative aspects can be found if you are dining on the patio. While I enjoy smoked meat, the smoker is overpowering and I have left smelling like woodsmoke more than once, and had to go home and take a shower and change clothes. \n\nAlso, service seems to be far less consistent on the patio...as in, you can expect to not receive as much attention from staff if you are sitting outside.

Checking-in was a breeze, I received great customer service! The bellman was amazing too, he was very excited to assist with the luggages and I mean I had a lot, well it was my friends luggages too. The room that I stayed in was the Junior Suite at the Signature which was suppose to be a balcony suite but there must of been some type of misunderstanding! The room was equipped with a mini kitchenette, a very large bathroom with a tub & shower, King size bed and a foldout Queen couch-bed.

Anyways, the towers are all connected to one even though they don't look like it! They're also connected to the MGM Grand, it leads you to the Monorail & food court.\nThis hotels decor is beautiful and is up to date! I especially like the little photo kiosk in tower 2 as you're entering the hotel. I took so many photos but I only relieved one via email, now that tells you something - drunk people are photogenic and I probably misspelled my email lol.\nI also went to the pool party here! Wet Republic, oh! It was great- I had random people purchasing me alcoholic beverages just because it was my Birthday (thanks guys!) I believe I was intoxicated all weekend. Amazing music, great staff- I had towels delivered to me lol.\nOver all, I would definitely stay at this hotel again and would definitely recommend my friends.",

We then shared the stuffed hot cherry peppers, my friend enjoyed these more than I did. I wasn't aware they were breaded and fried, I was thinking they were like the stuffed peppers at Cuginos (I love those things). Then our pie arrived....it was a show stopper. It was excellent right down to the crust. Our server was really friendly and managed to continue to check on us even though she was swamped. She brought us a couple cookies to take home. I hear the cannolis are good here (I'm probably the only Italian who doesn't like cannolis). I'd definitely come back when craving a white pizza, or even just cheese!",

At that point Sasha provided us with a purely pressure free sales experience, and walked us around to the different watches he wanted to see. One of the floor managers came over as well, and offered us a drink while we were looking. \n\nWe came back the next day to see Sasha and to make a purchase. Again, she was extremely accommodating. my husband picked out the watch that he wanted to purchase, and again a floor manager came over and offered the two of us a glass of Champagne. This time we did accept to celebrate.\n\nThe entire process was made simple and straight forward, once the purchase was complete Sasha showed us around the store and never rushed us once our transaction was complete.

Toni was very accomodating and came in early on a Friday morning to make sure I could get my hair done with plenty of time before I had to be at work at 11:30 AM.\n\nThe salon serves up water AND coffee in the mornings. I was treated to a nice cup of joe while getting my hair done.\n\nAlso of note, the salon is very clean and I love the ambiance - the Craftsman toolboxes where the hair dressers keep their stuff is awesome.

A larger replica of the original in New York, (haven't yet been to the one they opened up locally in Los Angeles) this quaint Italian restaurant has legit QUALITY Italian food, great atmosphere, impeccable service and not to mention a pretty fabulous wine list. \n\nRao's is located inside of Caesars Palace hotel. We typically make reservations to avoid the disappointment of it being too crowded to get a table. The back area that faces the hotel pool has a lovely view, and the interior sections (that actually replicate the tiny original restaurant in NY) are slightly less lit, but still with a great ambience and additional intimacy. We're happy no matter where we sit ! \n\nThe menu here is simplistic and just absolutely delicious. My fiancé says the Linguine Carbonara is HANDS DOWN the best he's ever had (even compared to multiple spots in Italy!) and I'm never disappointed with any of their seafood pasta dishes (or wine !). You can expect to spend north of $100 for two (with drinks).

They no longer have those buffalo sliders you can only get it in a chicken sandwich.

You gotta try the broccoli and cauliflower cheese bake, and the oven chips with garlic and jalapeño.\n\nLastly, the desserts. A few options here, including strawberry pavlova, pb&j pasty, and caramel apple pasty. The showstopper is the STP aka Shirley Temple Pudding aka Sticky Toffee Pudding.

I decided on Ginger and Bell (ginger, peppers, onions, pineapple, mushrooms, green onions) with shrimp. Jon B went with Pad Thai and chicken. Both were delicious. We also got Thai Iced Teas. I could drink a gallon of those. Note: you can order pickup online on their website. \n\nI have to say, the woman working the counter was so beyond sweet and nice. She fully explained the menu, walked us through the process of ordering and dining. Since it was our first time there, she brought us each a fried donut with a condensed milk dipping sauce. So good.",

And this gem of a human being noticed our pool people hadn't done their job at all! KC called to tell me that our pool skimmer was making an awful noise, so after he sprayed, he cleaned out our skimmer and removed the blockage causing the problem by getting the nasty clog out, and he also removed the debris from our pool. He treated us like family. I even had to call the owner to let them know how above and beyond he went. He didn't have to care, but he did. His kindness will not go unnoticed. I will always use companies who treat their customers with care, but this was just out of this world. Again: Thank you so much, KC. :)",

    "text": "One of my favorite place to eat, JOE'S!!! Forget Red Lobster, if you want quality seafood and you are not by the ocean, this is THE place. One this occasion I wanted crabs (duh) and muscles. So what did I order? A steampot naturally! This pot contained legs, scallops, muscles, and the standard corn and potatoes.  As is tradition, I asked for a side of Old Bay and a bottle of malt vinegar to create my own paste, which I greedily dunk the meat in. The server, Nicole, was very patient as I requested these things and when I asked for Sweet N Low for my iced tea, I wasn't upset when she explained that they didn't carry it. \n\nI got a side of hushpuppies to accompany my feast and was not disappointed in the least. I believe I may have converted Darren when he tried one after he told me he didn't like hushpuppies. \n\nGrowing up close to the Chesapeake Bay area, I have perfected the art of picking crabs and managed to get all of the meat out of almost every leg segment in whole. Darren loves watching me at work, never using a fork, and rarely using the nut crackers, or what they call crab crackers. These scallops were the best I have ever had! Seared on only one side and deliciously soft and juicy on the inside. The muscles were also amazing! I was saddened that I didn't have an endless plate of scallops and muscles. I have to say that I did have a pleasant surprise. When I was finished I looked under the plate that was in the pot and noticed an extra scallop and extra muscle! It felt like getting a small bonus!  \n\nI got the chocolate cake for dessert. It was huge! The flavor was ok, but I took home the few bites I couldn't finish and discovered that the cake tasted better after sitting in the fridge for a few hours.  I CAN'T WAIT TO EAT AT JOE'S AGAIN!",

Sometimes we patrons out here in Henderson are passed over in favor of the glitz and glamour of the Strip, so we're stuck with whomever decides to grace us with their culinary presence.\n\nWell thank goodness Tony Gemignani and crew did, because the food is incredible. We started with the meatball appetizers - amazing. The meatball is dense enough to get a good bite, but not so dense that it's dry. The gravy (sauce) is amazingly robust without being too acidic. Plus it has just the right amount of chunks of tomato in it.\n\nWe moved on to the Fried Green Tomato Caprese. The tomato is bathed in a beautiful corn meal crust, fried lightly, and bedded on top of generous chunks of mozzarella with basil and a perfect balsamic reduction. This was a definite plate licker.\n\nThe beer selection is amazing for a 'pizza joint'. Lots of good selection on tap - ask your server for their recommendations! Beer turns over quickly here, so don't be sad if something is out.\n\nWe moved on to the New Yorker (amazing! STOP modifying this pizza, people!) with it's lovely mounds of fresh ricotta that meld with everything once you fold that pie and take a bite (you better be folding these slices!). My husband also ordered the pear and prosciutto and that was a great take on a creative twist. \n\nThe atmosphere is really great, the flow is pleasing and the wait staff is surprisingly attentive and polite.

Since I was in the neighborhood and the weather is cold today, I figured this is the perfect day to try out spicy/hot Thai food. \n\nThe interior of this restaurant is very modern and beautifully designed. I love the paintings and mirrors that are hang on the walls. When we first walked in, we were greed by a very friendly waitress. We started out by ordering Thai iced tea and egg rolls as an appetizer.  Their tea has the perfect portion of milk, tea and sweetness. I would have ordered another one if I had more room in my stomach. Egg rolls are very crispy, non-greasy and it goes very well with the sweet sauce that it was served with. For entrees, my friend ordered Red Curry chicken with rice (Thai spicy) and I ordered Drunken noodles with beef (medium hot). The curry is very tasty but it too hot for my taste. They offered generous portion of beef for my drunken noodles and it was so delicious. For dessert, we ordered Mango with sticky rice. Mango is so sweet with the perfect portion of rice covering with mouth watering coconut juice. Even though I was full, I finished 90% of it in less than 5 minutes. \n\nJib's cousin stopped by to introduce himself and I also saw a older lady coming out from the kitchen to check on the business. As we crossed eye contact, she smiled at me from a distance. Generally speaking, I do not expect much customer service or cleanness from Asian restaurants. Not this one - they blew my mind away.

And many people came in and out and ordered take-out. However, we came to eat in. And the restaurant had tables where we sat and were waited on. Not normal for a sandwich shop. But it was great.\n\nI tried the \"fry plate\", which was a plate of French fries covered with your choice of toppings. I had steak, onions and mushrooms. It was excellent.\n\nA friend tried the tri-tip fry plate and he claimed it was also excellent.\n\nThe prices were reasonable and the staff was kind. Food took a little longer than other sandwich shops but it was fresh , hot and crispy (I was delighted to have hot crispy fries, rather than old soggy ones)!\n\nI will go back and try the sandwiches another time to see if the place lives up to that part of its namesake.\n\n--\n\nUPDATE: I did return and had a sandwich- the Cuban. I loved it. I've had Cuban sandwiches before. This was perfect. As was the side (cheesy fries). This will be a main stay for me. Lots to try here.",

Allison picked us up right in time and we had nice conversation on the way to the site. As we drove, she gave detailed instructions on the bikes, land, and tour. Once we arrived, she went over safety and assigned bikes. We test drove them in the parking lot so we could get a feel for how the bikes worked and then set off on our trip. A guide in the front and Allison in the back, they made sure everyone was safe and together, even as we all went our own speeds. We biked a total of 16 miles and let me tell you on an ebike, it only felt like a couple. It was a comfortable ride and cooler out there because of the wind from riding. We stopped at 4 points and Allison gave us information on the park. \n\nI definitely recommend Allison's ebike tour!!",

They kept great communication with me about the product arrival time and date. I wish I could take these two gentlemen to every store that I shop at on a regular basis and have them teach every employee at those stores the proper way to treat a customer. There is a Dicks way closer to my house, but I'll for sure take the longer drive to this store solely because they appreciate their customers that much.",

Although I've never been to India myself, I trust their opinion. \nI have eaten a lot of Indian food from a lot of different restaurants, and Lageez is definitely the best Indian food I've ever had. We ordered the mixed vegetable appetizers, butter chicken (of course), chicken Tikka masala, spinach and paneer, naan, and rice. Everything was incredible.

    "text": "On a recent trip back to the burgh in June,  we had already had Thai at our usual hangout and decided to go out for Thai a second time.  Being that NTK had made the top 25 restaurants in the burgh, i had to try it. So we made a rez and headed over.\n\nLet's start by saying it is in an interesting neighborhood.  They are rehabbing lots of houses so there is some other activity on the street.  But it is a teenie tiny little house converted to a restaurant.\n\nWhen you enter, you will look at those front steps and think \"it's not too late to turn around\" - but ignore the cracked steps and keep going.\n\nThen you enter the house and walk down a long hallway when you think \"i should have turned around at the steps\" but keep walking.\n\nWhen they seat you, you immediately realize that you are in a tiny little dining room and it is rather cozy.\n\nAnd then - the menu comes.  Wow. Just wow.  Yeah, they have pad thai. and they have curry. and they have rad na noodles. and then they have lots of other choices - vegetarian, thai-hesitant (for those who don't like thai or are fearful of thai), and just some really really cool dishes.\n\nSo here goes the rundown of what was ordered.\n\nThe appetizer dog choice was the fresh spring rolls. So how do you differentiate yourself from the competition?  Slice them into manageable chunks so that they can be shared easily and dipped into that Yummy  dipping sauce.\n\nI start with me as I can't rave enough about what I had.  Phar Luck Chicken.  it was a plate of steamed veggies (gr beans, snow peas, broccoli) covered with rice noodles, chicken breasts that were lightly spiced, then a peanut sauce on top.  I ordered a level 5 not knowing how it would be as one restaurant's 5 is another one's 3or 7.  Veggies were nicely steamed and crisp.  The chicken was mildly spiced atop a bed of noodles. And finished with a medium spiced peanut sauce. Just enough to taste but not over soaked.  And the surprise?  Two shrimps and some lump crabmeat.\n\nOk chef - one comment here. I loved the seafood but I know not everyone can eat that so including something that can trigger an allergic reaction without disclosing it can lead to disaster. And no customer would ever assume to ask about shrimp in a chicken dish.  Maybe add it to the description or have waitstaff mention it when it is ordered?\n\nDH had green curry with chicken.  Lots of veggies, nicely spiced but nothing out of the ordinary.  It was good but maybe not as strong of a curry taste as he was used to.  But it held its own with the other Thai restaurants.\n\nDSS had crab pineapple fried rice.  Ok. Seriously. How could you not love that combo. It took self-restraint on my part to not just grab that plate from him. Now THAT was an unusual combo I have never seen elsewhere and according to DSS, it was great (first sign of a good dish?  No offers to share :)\n\nOur server was excellent.  Never was a water glass empty.  plates were removed promptly. We were never rushed as we lingered in conversation.  \n\nSo this is now added to my \"places to visit when back in the burgh\" list.\n\n\n7/16. Update.\nI decided while back in the burgh again on business to revisit NTK.  I ordered takeout to nibble back at the hotel.  A few comments. \n1.  The Phar Luck was as good as I remembered.  Yum again\n2.  I passed on an appetizer so I could Try their sticky rice with custard.  Imagine my surprise when I opened it and discovered black sticky rice....oh my....wow.  Topped with a square of creamy smooth custard topped with coconut.  Again the little details that make NTK just stand out from the pack.\n3.  I was surprised to be charged a surcharge for a takeout order.  Seriously? Each item was marked up for the privilege of saving them the salary they pay their waitstaff when I took the food out. No, it is not a big deal (a little over 10% or so). Again, disclosure would have been nice. Or no surcharge at all.\n4.  Speaking of takeout, chef, how about using some of that surcharge to pay for decent plastic ware? I don't do chopsticks and found that it was impossible to spear the steamed veggies with those dollar store forks. Since I was in a hotel without a kitchen, that was the only fork I had and when it snapped in the broccoli....well....let's just say it wasn't pretty.  So maybe think about some decent flatware, so I don't need to pack my own next time I get takeout?",

I had never felt anything worse in my entire life. I literally felt as though the doctor treated me as though I was nothing but a dollar sign. It was my first baby so i really didn't know any different.\n\nThen i found Dr. Kelley when i was pregnant with my second and i appreciated his get-to-the-point attitude. It was great to just hear it straight. He examined my previous c-section scar and told me it looked very unusual (which immediately followed me bursting into tears because i knew that the previous doctor didn't take his time and possibly didn't care).  I didn't expect Dr. Kelley to hold my hand and tell me everything was going to be ok - instead he explained that he would remove my old scar altogether and make it look better. And he did. \n\nMy second delivery (in 2013) via c-section was a dream compared to the first. I initially went into labor 6 days early on my own to which the triage nurses ended up calling him in the middle of the night and by the time he got there, my contractions subsided but since he was already there, he said \"Let's have a baby!\"  I don't know what he did different but it was practically painless!  I couldn't have been more happy!\n\nMy third (in 2016) was even better. He made sure that I was comfortable while I was in the hospital recovering and even let me leave a day early. \n\nI delivered at Summerlin for each of my kids and Dr. Kelley was amazing for my last two. He may be a little \"cold\" at appointments but it's because he's not there to waste anyone's time. He knows when to lighten up and when to keep it professional and, for me, that's what I need. I really enjoyed his staff as well - I've never had a problem with them either. I appreciated that I saw him at ever single one of my OB appointments.",

If they can keep this up they are going to do very, very well.\n\nEdit: \nSo I think I owe it to the fantastic guys at Roast to expand on my review and explain exactly why this place is going to do so well.  In no particular order, here's what makes Roast a fantastic addition to State Street.\n\n1. The Ingredients\nApparently, most of the stuff is locally sourced.  Personally, I don't care if they fly it in by zeppelin from Timbuktu, the important thing is that the food they are serving is fresh and high quality.  And the bread... oh, God, the bread.  Let's just say it's good.\n\n2. The Sandwiches\nEvery single sandwich is brilliantly designed on a conceptual level.  They're all based on traditional favorites, but most have a slight twist that really brings it home.  All the ingredients make sense; none is randomly chosen.    And where lesser restauranteurs might slap all their sandwiches on the same roll, that's not the case here.  Each is perfectly paired with the right bread for the job.  \n\nAlso, I have to mention the absolutely ingenious decision to include a layer of lightly friend cheddar mashed potatoes on the turkey with cranberry-jalapeno relish special last week.  Brilliant!\n\n3. The atmosphere. \nThey've really done a nice job reshaping the Buffalo Wild WIngs Space.  It's more open than it has been, the color schemes are great, and the whole space is inviting.  Definitely check out the basement (you might not even realize it's there)-- it's a really fantastic lounge area with a ping-pong table.  It's awesome.\n\n4. The service \nIt's incredibly consistent, especially for such a new place.  I stopped in last week and the place was packed with drunken undergrads and yet I still managed to get in and out in a few minutes with my takeout order.  It seems like they can prepare a whole order in the amount of time it takes Hawks to spoon out a bowl of chili.\n\n5. The Owners\nThese guys really deserve a round of applause.  They're all young guys, they're all taking a big risk, and they are all working their butts off. To top it off, they're all incredibly nice and sincere.   These guys aren't playing at being restauranteurs-- they've thought long and hard, come up with a really great concept, and are doing everything they possibly could to make it succeed.  State Street is lined with restaurants that are poorly conceived, poorly-run, badly-valued etc. etc. and yet somehow still manage to stay open.  WIth the addition of Roast, the bar has truly risen.\n\nThanks for bringing your incredible work to Madison, guys.  I really think you're going to make a well-deserved mint off this place.",

I wanted to try some vegetarian poutine and my options for this in Canada were pretty limited so  I was pleased to see that this was an option here. I got the vegetarian poutine with poached eggs and some greens on the bottom as well.\n\nThe staff here were so friendly and lovely. I had a particularly nice conversation with the lady who took my order. Afterwards she and I talked about where I was from and she asked a lot of questions (I was visiting from out of the country). She was just so sweet! My food came out pretty quickly.\n\nIt was absolutely delicious!! When I got home I almost inhaled it because it was so good. I loved the gravy used. It went beautifully with the eggs and the fries and the avocado on top was fresh and yummy. The greens actually went really well with it. I got them at the recommendation fo the woman who took my order but was a little hesitant. She was right, they were excellent! I really enjoyed my poutine!",

Open 24/7 but Very cute set up, a little more on the trendy side and not your normal 24/7 cafe place. \n\nOur food was delicious. We all got a variety of different things, and they all were great! We had the Octopus Pizza, the Burger, the Breakfast Platter, and the applewood smoked ham and turkey sandwich.\n\nThe thing that truly made our visit great was the service from everyone Danielle our waitress- Jonathon- our waiter/bus boy and the Bar Manager Adrian. Everyone was so friendly and great. I would like to especially recognize Jonathon for his above and beyond service to us, even offering us water cups to go since it's hot outside! He was great.\n\nWe will definitely be back. I am in the restaurant industry and heard this is their first one on the West Coast- so I truly do wish you all the best of Luck! Continue with the great food and service and you will do well- that's the recipe for success! Thanks again and see you all next time!",

Arsen, our waiter suggested we try the calamari on greens as an appetizer.  We loved it.  Although you can't go wrong with fried calamari , when you place it on greens the dressing and dip become very relevant and they turned out to be a perfect combination.  It was a true Irish pub, in the sense that the beer was a highlight-so we tried a sampler and we were not disappointed.  I had salmon on greens with strawberries and blackberries and my husband had chicken skewered satay on kale that he originally chose reluctantly.  In the end, he was very pleased. The ambience was great since we ate outside with the music playing. I highly recommend this restaurant.",

It was the day after I have been the most drunk I've ever been in my entire life (all put together, pretty much).  The next day, as we waited in a long line to eat brunch at the famous A&U, I puked on the street.  Needless to say, it wasn't a good representation of all this place has to offer.\n\nCome here during the week, and there's not such a line.  A steady stream of people meant every table was always being used, but we didn't have to wait.  At first we got this tiny half-moon table, but we quickly upgraded to the window when another couple vacated.\n\nThe coffee was great, hot, refilled quickly.  We each had the scrambled eggs, with it you get to pick 3 sides from a choice of about 10.  I had the potato salad (loads of dill, marinated olives), the bacon (4 whole slices, really yum) and the fruit, which was actually piping hot cinnamon poached pears.  Ummmm yummy.  Really good value as well ($8.25) for how much food you get, and the quality.\n\nWill definitely be back....just not on the weekends (or when I have alcohol poisoning, I guess).",

Then I noticed that I work just a couple of miles from here and I knew a Gelati was in my imminent future.\n\nWell it happened, a mere two days after hearing about the mythological creature known as a Gelati I found myself driving over to Rita's and ordering one.  It was magnificent, but I'm getting ahead of myself and skipping over the fabulous favor offerings that you can combine in your Gelati...\n\nFirst off you pick the type of frozen custard you want.  I saw vanilla and chocolate and I think there were other flavors too, probably lowfat ones...?  Plain old vanilla is my game.  (I like a simple and classic base flavor if I'm about to 'get funky' with the rest of my frozen treat, you know what I mean?)\n\nNext you pick either one or two Italian Ice flavors to 'sandwich' the serving of frozen custard in the middle.  The Italian Ice favors varied from strawberry, mango, pineapple, cotton candy, and I think I even saw a marshmallow one too.  These Italian Ices are indeed as fresh and tasty as they sound.  I know this because I tried a couple of them...delicious!\n\nI ended up choosing strawberry and pineapple as my Italian Ice combination.  There were real pieces of strawberry blended into the Italian Ice, it was stupendous!  The frozen custard tasted like someone had taken the creamy custard base of a creme brulee and churned it into frozen silken cream...\n\nThe silky, velvety creaminess of the frozen custard blended with the tangy, fruity zing of the Italian Ice was a magical combination was a thing of beauty.\n\nPS: I think they mix up the Italian Ice offerings a bit, so the flavors you may see when you go will probably be different from the ones I saw.  And you WILL go, trust me...  ;)",

Can be a busy place so seating can be at a premium, and only one outlet to plug laptops into (seriously, my only beef with this place, hope the owner sees this and adds some more extension cords), but other than that, it gets top marks in my books.",

Free Wifi near registration Lobby and free usage of computers in the same area. Very friendly and supportive staff. \n\nPretty Moderate prices compared Marriott in downtown.\nYou can take a shuttle from Airport (747 express) to go to downtown and it runs for 24 hours. It is just 8$ for round trip which you can use multiple times in 24 hours.\n\nOverall - Great Experience.",

Our favorite items on the menu are the salmon burger, grilled salmon wrap, fish tacos, and fish & chips. The fish always tastes fresh and well-seasoned, the service is always friendly and extremely fast, and the prices are very reasonable. Orders take under 10 minutes to make so if you live nearby, it's a great take-out option--call in your order and it'll be ready when you arrive. If you eat there, there are some small tables and counter space. There's no outdoor seating, but on nice days they pull the window up all the way, turning the counter seats near the entrance into an open air option.\n\nThe one time I got served the wrong type of fish in my wrap, the person at the counter immediately apologized and insisted on giving me both wraps for the price of one.\n\nOverall, we're happy to have The One That Got Away in our neighborhood and usually go at least once every week or two.",

The owner was a great guy, even gave a quick rundown of the menu items. We ordered: grilled pork banh mi, vermicelli bowl with 3 items and no peanut (egg roll, grilled pork and fried tofu), pho (item 1a... I totally forgot all the cuts of meat in there), pork and shrimp spring roll with no crushed peanut in the peanut sauce and Vietnamese limeade. My only complaint was not leaving enough room in my belly to try their flan! There was another customer raving about how delicious it was when she had it on a different visit. I personally had the vermicelli bowl and the freshness of the veggies was very evident. The egg roll was crispy with flavorful filling. The tofu was fried perfectly and the grilled pork was obviously marinated well and grilled perfectly. The pork was moist! I tried a few scoops of the broth from my sisters pho and the depth of flavor was deff there. My hubby wrote his own review on the restaurant and his banh mi, giving it 5 stars! The spring rolls were yum.... and the limeade was absolutely fresh and perfect for these hot Vegas summers! I can't wait to come back and grub some more!",

    "text": "My all-time favourite burger in the city. No matter where I travel, I always end up comparing a burger I try elsewhere to a Golden Star burger. The homemade is the only way to go at Golden Star; juicy burgers cooked on a grill by staff who have been there since I was a kid. Service is always fast and friendly. Decor hasn't changed in years, and likely isn't going to change. Fine by me, but it would be nice if one day they started taking credit cards. For now, as it has always been, cash only. \n\nI usually ask for my fries well-done. As the fries are thicker cut fries, I find that sometimes when Golden Star is busy, the fries tend to get undercooked. Some friends enjoy the less-done fries, so I guess it is just a personal preference. \n\nThe grape drink is a classic and a must have! Don't forget... they have great BBQ sauce and fried onions to top off their burgers.",

Get the large (20\"), cut it in half (two 10\" sandwiches) and share with somebody.  Nice bread... SUPER tasty pastrami... but the coleslaw on it is where it's at.  Good cold crunch that keeps you coming back for the next bite quicker than you thought you would.\n\nNever really busy... a lot of locals order to go, so they just come in, pay, leave.  So plenty of seating for us out of towners.\n\nIt's in a VERY tiny strip mall near the corner of Sahara and The Strip.",

I brought roommate Roy so twice the food can try. lol! I went with the chicken katsu loco moco. It was good. I feel that thinking about local moco anything but hamburger just not the same. Yelpers do or my philosophy with food never know until you try!! The brown gravy (its winnah for sure nice flavor could see it loco moco or just over two scoops rice) combine with chicken katsu never worked for me. On the other hand my roommate had the portuguese omelette fried rice that was unreal Ono! Just like back in the islands with the char su diced up and depth of flavor in the rice. It hearty rice local style. I wanted too try some of the desserts. I got the haupia cake. Winnah too! It three layers of coconut heaven! Just like the first visit going too Island Flavor bring back all good things about the islands music, food, and sense of ohana. \n\nThe portion size.....WoW! I knew after the first visit the size more like cheesecake factory. So if looking for value for sure local food way too go and by far out if any local places ever been too in Vegas the amount of starch or rice sure unreal. Even the protein or main dish get nice size portion. The dessert NO small piece of cake either. Sure plan on coming back trying out more local food on the menu!!",
